              <h3>What is done?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard RAG system:</strong> chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing / chunking / embedding:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Download 30 cores PDFs (suggested by chatGPT) mostly from Comptroller and other sources</li>
                    <li>Transcribe PDFs to text, for image-heavy pages, use OCR and pass text along with the image to LLM for detail description</li>
                    <li>Chunk and use OpenAI to embed and store in SQLite database</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Hybrid search: BM25 + vector</li>
                    <li>I put in a reranker but it's cpu intensive so I threw it out the window</li>
                    <li>Implement simple deduplication and limit the context for faster response</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Generation:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Settle with claude-3.5-sonnet because it's cheap and fast. Plus using a highly intelligent model feels kinda like cheating ðŸ˜…</li>
                    <li>Retrieve, append some additional instructions, and call OpenRouter</li>
                    <li>Stream the response for better user experience</li>
                    <li>If user select to search the web, OpenRouter handles that, I take no credit</li>

              <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>In short, a lot ðŸ¥²</li>
                <li>I asked chatGPT for a list of questions to evaluate. The results are pretty bad, it hallucinates, especially bad with numbers and dates.</li>
                <li>Even for questions that's straight in the PDF knowledge base, it's not good.
                  <ul>
                    <li>For example, "tell me about Col Michelle Idle" it knows she's the Deputy Commander.</li>
                    <li>But, "tell me about Mr. Noble Smith" it says no information, and they appear on the same org chart.</li>
                    <li>I suspect OCR got the names wrong, but I checked and the names are correctly transcribed, so the hybrid search is probably bugged.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For web search, I rely entirely on OpenRouter, so not much control over the results.
                  <ul>
                    <li>The only touch I put in is a small instruction to tell it to prioritize reliable sources. like .org and .gov.</li>
                    <li>It finds most of the info on wikipedia.org, which is extremely unreliable ðŸ¥²</li>
                    <li>A web search API is definitely needed for fine-grained control</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Didn't have a lot of time to worry about design and responsiveness, might look like a total mess on mobile, idk.</li>
                <li>No security, no password, no rate throttling, nothing, but technically nothing is at risk though, there's $3 in my OpenRouter account, worst case is someone spamming 13,000 questions and deplete my account ðŸ¤£</li>
                <li>And debug messages everywhere, haven't cleaned them up yet...</li>
              </ul>

      "text": "III. Missile Threat\nRapidly evolving rogue and peer missile threats have led to a change in national defense policy, and MDA is responding with s peed \nand intensity to protect against threats from all adversaries.  We must deliver the missile defense capabilities we need in o rder to \nsupport the Warfighter and outpace emerging threats.  Our adversaries have become very capable and very intent on holding the \nhomeland at risk.  The threat from missiles is escalating, becoming more diverse and sophisticated.  Adversaries are deployin g \nmissiles that are harder to detect and destroy, with increased mobility, reliability, precision, and ranges.  The growth in b allistic and \nmaneuverable missile threats is driven by technological advancements and widespread access, proliferation and cooperation amo ng \nour adversaries to missile technology. \n \nChina is leading the way among our adversaries by developing and growing its offensive arsenal, including rapid advancement o f \nballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile capabilities.  China is expanding its nuclear arsenal at extraordinary speed.  The U.S . \nIntelligence Community assesses that China will have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030, many of which will  be \ndeployed at higher readiness levels.  China has already developed and deployed significant quantities of hypersonic missiles capable \nof striking U.S., allied, and partner military bases and fleets in the Indo -Pacific region.  \nNorth Korea is developing long-range ballistic missile systems that can reach the U.S. and its allies in the Indo -Pacific region.  It has \nalso tested shorter range missiles that maneuver within the atmosphere.  \nIn Europe, Russia continues to use air-, land-, and sea-launched cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles to target both civilian and \nmilitary infrastructure in Ukraine.  Russia is also increasing its cooperation with Iran and North Korea.  Iran has provided Russia with \nsignificant numbers of drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, while North Korea has provided Russia with ballist ic \nmissiles and launchers.\nIn the Middle East, Iran conducted the largest ballistic missile attacks in history while continuing to develop more sophisticat ed \nmissiles with improved accuracy, range, and lethality, including short-  and medium-range ballistic missile systems capable of \nthreatening deployed U.S. forces, allies, and partners in the Middle East.  Iran -backed militant groups continue use of Iranian \ntechnology, such as uncrewed aircraft systems, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, to target Israel, U.S. military force s, and \nmaritime commercial shipping operating in the Red Sea, the Bab al -Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. \n \nReal-world events and combat operations over the past year illustrate the evolving nature of missile threats and how delivery of  new \ncapabilities is imperative to meeting them.  In 2024, ballistic missile attacks on Israel from multiple fronts repeatedly and  vividly \ndemonstrated the growing nature of the threat and put our joint capabilities to the test, including capabilities developed or  co-\ndeveloped by MDA such as the Standard Missile-3, THAAD system, AN/TPY-2 radars, command and control systems and the Israeli \nMissile Defense System.  On April 14 and October 1, 2025, Iran attacked Israel with massive raids of Medium Range Ballistic \nMissiles (MRBMs).  These raids represent, by far, the largest MRBM raids the world has experienced.  The effective integratio n of the \nU.S. and Israeli MDS and our ability to deliver critical missile defense capabilities saved thousands of lives by actively de feating \nIranian attacks.\nThe evolving threat landscape requires new, faster, more responsive capabilities.\n3\nVolume 2a - xxiv"

Budget Overview Portfolio Highlights\nTo improve responsive delivery of capabilities to the warfighter and optimize resources across the Agency, MDA restructured in 2025 \nby streamlining responsibilities across Program Executives, Enabling Directorates, and Agency Support Organizations.  Using a \nportfolio approach, MDA consolidated mission-specific capabilities into single organizations that better align with the Department and \nthe Services.  Recognizing evolving threats beyond legacy missiles defense systems, MDA is also creating a new organization to \ndevelop next-generation capabilities.  The restructuring strengthens support for the Services and Warfighter by improving coordination \nand positioning MDA to effectively implement the Golden Dome for America architecture.  \nProactive transformation to meet emerging needs and \nimprove warfighter responsiveness\nThe FY 2026 President’s Budget delivers the resources \nnecessary to operate, build, and sustain an effective and \nlethal MDS and initiate planning and development of \ncritical capabilities to deliver on the President’s bold vision \nfor missile defense.  Figure 1 breaks out the $13.2 billion \nbudget by major appropriation group.  This budget \nrepresents a $2.8 billion increase (27%) over our FY 2025 \nenacted President’s Budget.\nSpecific program highlights in MDA’s Fiscal Year \n2026 budget request include:\n• Developing and demonstrating a C2 data mesh supporting critical \nearly delivery for Golden Dome for America\n• Developing GDA Underlayer capabilities including a Network \nEnabled Interceptor (NEI) capability for the Standard Missile-3 \n(SM-3) Block IIA, and the \nExpeditionary Launcher\n• Accelerates the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program \nby two years\n• Delivers the Joint Tactical Integrated Fire Control \nCapability (JTIFC)\n• Sources a second solid rocket motor for the \nNext Generation Interceptor (NGI)\n• Procures long-lead material for a second Discriminating Space \nSensor (DSS)\n• Initiates planning for a third CONUS Interceptor Site and \nimproved ground-based homeland defense sensor architecture\nRDT&E\n$10,531.7\n80%\nProcurement\n$1,606.6\n6%\nMILCON\n$306.4\nO&M\n$720.4\n12%\n2%\n4\nVolume 2a - xxv"

Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Portfolio\nRDT&E\n10,531.7\n80%\nThe GMD Weapon System has safeguarded the U.S. homeland \nagainst long-range ballistic missile threats for over two decades.  The \nMDA continues on-going modernization efforts, including the Next \nGeneration Interceptor (NGI), which is a technologically advanced \nbooster that can deliver multiple kill vehicle, and is designed to augment \nthe Ground-Based Interceptor fleet.  The NGI will be the most modern, \nreliable, and technically advanced interceptor for the defense of our \nnation.  Ground-Based Radars play a vital role in filling sensor gaps and \nenhancing the effectiveness of Ground-Based Interceptors by improving \ndetection, tracking, and threat discrimination, strengthening defense \ncapabilities against the evolving threats.  Both the NGI and Ground-Based \nRadars are critical capabilities supporting GDA.  The budget request is \n$3.2 billion and includes the following highlights:\nDecision Dominance Command & Control is vital for rapid \nthreat assessment, coordinated response, and effective threat \ninterception.  These capabilities enable missile defenses to analyze \nincoming threats through the MDS’s integrated network of radars \nsatellites, and surveillance systems.  By assessing countermeasures \nand determining the best course of action, these elements create a \nhighly synchronized MDS, one that detects, decides when and how \nto act, and defeats missile threats with accuracy and efficiency.  This \nportfolio funds and strengthens MDA’s Command and Control, \nBattle Management and Communications (C2BMC) along with its \nspace capabilities.  Further, MDA delivers, maintains, and upgrades \nC2BMC capability across 19 time zones with hardened networks \nsupporting the CCMDs.

Neither documentation \nfrom the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) nor the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) books match the \ninformation for additional funds included in the Services' justification documents. Nor do the descriptions of \nactivities seem to change. In examining the documents, some of the descriptions are exactly the same year to year.   \nTherefore, the Committee directs that the PDI and EDI justification documents be augmented with the \nsubmission of the fiscal year 2024 justification materials to include the following: \n(1) Each individual activity receiving funds will include the amount of increase in funding (not an overall top line \nincrease);  \n(2) Each individual activity will also include the baseline of funds from the previous fiscal year. Each augmented \nprogram or activity will specify which service, account, subactivity group or program element line is increasing.  \nSubmitted in the FY2025 Budget \nJustification Materials in PE \n0604102C (Guam Defense \nDevelopment); 0603892C (Aegis \nBMD); 0603896C (BMD C2BMC); \n0603914C (BMD Test); 0603915C \n(BMD Targets); 0604878C (Aegis \nBMD Test); 0604879C (BMD \nSensor Test); and 0208902C \n(Defense of Guam Procurement) \n \n \nFY19 National Defense \nAuthorization Act (H.R. \n5515), Report 115-863, \npp. 257-258; \nFY20 National Defense \nAuthorization Act (S. \n1790), Report 116-333, \np. 338 \n \nCONSOLIDATED BUDGET DISPLAY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SMALL BUSINESS \nINNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER \nPROGRAM \nThe Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, shall include \nin the materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in support of the budget of the President for each \nfiscal year (as submitted to Congress under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code) , a budget display for the \nfunds assessed for the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram (as such terms are defined, respectively, in section 9(e) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(e))) of the \nDepartment of Defense during the previous fiscal year. \nMODIFICATIONS TO BUDGET DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nSMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY \nTRANSFER PROGRAM \nSection 857 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115 -232; \n132 Stat. 1891) is amended -  (1) in subsection (a)— (A) by inserting ‘‘Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) \nand the’’ before ‘‘Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering’’; and (B) by striking ‘‘a budget \ndisplay’’ and inserting ‘‘one or more budget displays’’; (2) in subsection (b), by striking ‘‘The budget display’’ and \ninserting ‘‘The budget displays’’; and (3) in subsection (d), by striking ‘‘The budget display’’ and inserting ‘‘The \nbudget displays’’. \nSubmitted in the FY2025 Budget \nJustification Materials in PE \n0605502C (Small Business \nInnovation Research – MDA) \n  Title 10 USC 551, Sec \n5511 \nBALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM ELEMENTS \n \n(c) MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT.—The amount requested for a fiscal year for any program element specified \nfor that fiscal year pursuant to subsection (a) shall include requests for the amounts necessary for the management \nand support of the programs, projects, and activities contained in that program element.  \nExhibit R-2As – MD40 Program-\nWide Support Budget Projects \nVolume 2a - xxxv"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nAdvanced Concepts and Performance Assessments (ACPA) centralizes advanced technology concept modeling, simulation, software, and analysis.  Integrating models\nof promising disruptive technical solutions into Missile Defense System system-level simulations enables leadership to make data driven acquisition and technology\ninvestment decisions.  Assess concepts that improve or adapt existing systems, such as the addition of mobile sensors or interceptors that can be surged into areas\nof conflict.  Examples of efforts required to quantify the contribution of disruptive technologies may include, but not limited to environmental experimentation and\nphenomenological characterization required for new sensor concepts, advanced weapon technologies, and emerging directed energy concepts.  In addition, facilitate\nstakeholder collaboration on advanced concepts to ensure transition into functional areas and programs of record.  Using a technology development testbed approach,\nACPA enables assessment and characterization of disruptive and incremental technology improvements to inform requirements and evaluate missile defense elements,\ncomponents, and/or sub-component technologies and to assess maturity as it relates to readiness for transition to the future Missile Defense System.  ACPA promotes\ninformed decision making early in the acquisition life-cycle to maximize investments and successful transition into the Missile Defense System.\nCoupled with characterization efforts, ACPA develops innovative left-through-right-of-launch modeling capabilities including physics-based representations in the areas\nof cyber, sensor technologies, lethality and survivability, communications, and sensor support.  ACPA is focusing on Science and Technology initiatives which increase\ninteroperability and leverages expertise with allied and service partners.\nACPA capitalizes on the innovation of small businesses, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and University Affiliated Research Centers\nto pursue a broad range of hardware, software, models, algorithms, trade studies, and analysis.  These innovations bring together government developed models\nrepresenting existing and future missile defense architectures, technology concepts, and advanced algorithms to provide detailed assessments of concept performance\nand inform investment decisions. These innovations, combined with a robust high performance computing infrastructure, provide a unique in-house government\ncapability to demonstrate and assess technology concepts for emerging technology risk reduction, to mature concepts with laboratory, ground, and flight test data, and\nwhere possible, apply concepts in simulated exercises with weapon systems across representative communication architectures.\nAdvanced Concepts for Disruptive Cyber assesses technology and techniques, which move beyond the incremental gains in power balance with a focus on expanding\nthe domain and reach of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) capabilities as well as those with asymmetric countermeasures whether in cost, effect, or defensibility.\nVolume 2a - 3"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nPAC-3 is an operational, land-based weapon built upon the proven United States (U.S.) Army Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) air and\nmissile defense infrastructure.   The Army is responsible for production and further development of the PAC-3 System and Missile Segment Enhancements (MSE); the\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) remains responsible for any Missile Defense System interoperability and integration efforts.  The Army will utilize MDA funds to further\nthe integration of PATRIOT with the Missile Defense System.\nPreviously this project included the Army's portion of the Joint Emergent Operational Need including:\n1) PATRIOT launch on remote to utilize Terminal High Altitude Area Defense's (THAAD's) capability to detect and track threat ballistic missiles at longer ranges and\nutilize MSE's full kinematic capability.\n2) THAAD/MSE Integration Part 1 that integrates MSE launchers and missiles into the THAAD weapon system enabling a more tightly integrated upper/lower tier\ndefensive capability.\nB.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe GMD program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development. The GMD acquisition strategy ensures\nGMD products are upgraded to improve both GMD Weapon System performance to meet Warfighter requirements and defeat the allocated threats. This acquisition\napproach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability improvements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost, schedule, and\nperformance while rapidly delivering improved operational and technological capabilities.\nThe MDA competitively awarded the DSC to The Boeing Company in December 2011. This contract included development, fielding, testing, systems engineering,\nintegration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrades; training, operations, and sustainment of the GMD Element; and associated support\nfacilities. In January 2018, the DSC was extended with a new period of performance through 1Q FY 2024. The DSC Extension included supporting test, engineering,\nsoftware, and performance-based logistics scope. In 2022, the MDA Ground Test Replan resulted in the extension of minimal contract line items to support testing,\nengineering, hardware and software until December 2024 to complete the delivery of Missile Defense System Increment 6B.2, while performance-based logistics\ntransitioned to a new contract after December 2023. In 2024, MDA extended the DSC period of performance until December 2025 for limited content to complete\ncongressionally mandated SLEP upgrades and fixed-priced Launch Support System-2 production and installation. The DSC structure breaks out major efforts into\nseparate Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nIn addition to the DSC, GMD's overarching acquisition strategy includes a Next Generation Interceptor contract; Ground Based Interceptor sustainment contracts; a\nGWS contract; and a SITR contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for Missile Defense System incremental delivery. Each of the contracts is\nstructured to break out major efforts into separate CLINs, with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nVolume 2a - 74"

These contracts are executing concurrently with the DSC and provide for transition periods while the DSC\nscope is completing to provide continuity of effort. Each of the new contracts are structured to break out major efforts into separate CLINs with individual incentives for\nmanagement insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nThe GWS Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to design, develop, produce, and test the upgrades to the GMD\nWeapon System. In addition, the GWS Contract included the sustainment planning and maintenance of the currently fielded GMD Weapon System. The GWS contractor\nis responsible for developing Weapon System solutions, including fire control and communication systems improvements, required to update the legacy system to\nremain effective while the Next Generation Interceptor is under development, as well as preparing for the seamless introduction of Next Generation Interceptor and\nother future Missile Defense System capabilities. The GWS contractor will incorporate the interface updates adding the Next Generation Interceptors to the fleet, provide\nUSNORTHCOM the capability to operate the GMD Weapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, and identify and\ndevelop solutions for message exchanges between the GMD Weapon System and in-flight payloads, all while maintaining a robust cyber defense network capable of\ndetecting and defending against current and future cybersecurity threats .\nThe SITR Contract was competitively awarded to The Boeing Company on September 1, 2022 to support the MDA as the GMD Weapon System Integrator by\nproviding a synergistic approach in executing the GMD engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the integrated GMD Weapon System. The SITR contractor\nis the Government's partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System alongside USNORTHCOM. While the Government maintains\noverall weapon system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR contractor assumes a supporting role by aiding with GMD Weapon System integration, GMD\ncontributions to Missile Defense System enterprise-level integration, and GMD requirements verification.\nThe GMD BSC was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021, and the ESC was awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems in June 2023. The Ground Based\nInterceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award to The Boeing Company in FY 2025. These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until\nthe replacement Next Generation Interceptors are fielded. These contractors maintain the existing fleet, perform service life extensions, execute repairs, and develop\nsoftware.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and program offices. With a focus on achieving small-business goals, MDA is leveraging existing MDA Consolidated Support\ncontracts and will utilize MDA competitively awarded new contracts to acquire future years Advisory and Assistance Services support.\nOther Enabling GMD Acquisition Strategies are budgeted for in PE 0604887C Test and PE 0604874C IHLD.\nVolume 2a - 75"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe GMD Cyber Operations project provides cybersecurity and cyber resiliency to maintain and operate all mission and mission support systems.  The GMD systems\nmust maintain Network and System Certification and Accreditation for operation on all GMD networks and nodes. Cybersecurity and Cyber Resiliency efforts harden the\nGMD system against a cyber-attack and reduces system vulnerabilities. The strategy implements cybersecurity and cyber resiliency systems throughout the lifecycle to\nflow requirements to the Ground Based Interceptor, Next Generation Interceptor, and GMD Weapon System to influence system development. In addition, Cybersecurity\nand Cyber Resiliency efforts include developmental cyber testing and assessments to reduce cyber vulnerabilities prior to fielding.\nB.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe GMD program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development. The GMD acquisition strategy ensures\nGMD products are upgraded to improve both GMD Weapon System performance in order to meet Warfighter requirements and defeat the allocated threats. This\nacquisition approach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability improvements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost,\nschedule, and performance while rapidly delivering improved operational and technological capabilities.\nThe MDA competitively awarded the DSC to The Boeing Company in December 2011. This contract included development, fielding, testing, systems engineering,\nintegration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrade; training, operations, and sustainment of the GMD Element; and associated\nsupport facilities. In January 2018, the DSC was extended with a new period of performance through 1Q FY 2024.  The DSC Extension included supporting test,\nengineering, software, and performance-based logistics scope. In 2022, the MDA Ground Test Replan resulted in the extension of minimal contract line items to\nsupport testing, engineering, hardware and software until December 2024 to complete the delivery of Missile Defense System Increment 6B.2, while performance-\nbased logistics transitioned to a new contract after December 2023. In 2024, MDA extended the DSC period of performance until December 2025 for limited content\nin order to complete congressionally mandated Service Life Extension Program upgrades and fixed-priced Launch Support System-2 production and installation. The\nDSC structure breaks out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property\naccountability.\nIn addition to the DSC, GMD's overarching acquisition strategy includes a Next Generation Interceptor contract; Ground Based Interceptor sustainment contracts; a\nGWS contract; and a SITR contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for Missile Defense System incremental delivery. Each of the contracts is\nstructured to break out major efforts into separate CLINs, with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nThe Ballistic Missile Defense Midcourse Segment acquisition strategy includes the transition from DSC to SITR, GWS, Next Generation Interceptor, and Ground Based\nInterceptor sustainment contracts.  These contracts are executing concurrently with the DSC and provide for transition periods while the DSC scope is completing to\nprovide continuity of effort.  Each of the new contracts are structured to break out major efforts into separate CLINs with individual incentives for management insight,\naccounting, and property accountability.\nThe GWS Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to design, develop, produce, and test upgrades to the GWS.\nIn addition, the GWS Contract included the sustainment planning and maintenance of the currently fielded GMD Weapon System.  The GWS contractor is responsible\nVolume 2a - 117"

The GWS contractor will incorporate the interface updates adding the Next Generation Interceptors to the fleet, provide USNORTHCOM\nthe capability to operate the GMD Weapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, and identify and develop solutions\nfor message exchanges between the GMD Weapon System and in-flight payloads, all while maintaining a robust cyber defense network capable of detecting and\ndefending against current and future cybersecurity threats.\nThe SITR Contract was competitively awarded to The Boeing Company on September 1, 2022 to support the MDA as the GMD Weapon System Integrator by\nproviding a synergistic approach in executing the GMD engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the integrated GMD Weapon System. The SITR contractor\nis the Government's partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System alongside USNORTHCOM.  While the Government maintains\noverall weapon system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR contractor assumes a supporting role by aiding with GMD Weapon System Integration, GMD\ncontributions to Missile Defense System enterprise-level integration, and GMD requirements verification.\nThe GMD BSC was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021, and the ESC was awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems in June 2023. The Ground Based\nInterceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award to The Boeing Company in FY 2025. These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until\nthe replacement Next Generation Interceptors are fielded. These contractors maintain the existing fleet, perform service life extensions, execute repairs, and develop\nsoftware.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and program offices.  In FY 2024, GMD began an effort to transition cybersecurity tasks from the SITR Contract to the\nMDA Consolidated Support Missile Defense System Engineering contract in order to gain funding efficiency.  With a focus on achieving small business goals, MDA\nis leveraging existing MDA Consolidated Support contracts and will utilize MDA competitively awarded new contracts to acquire future years advisory and assistance\nservices support.\nThe Integrated Research and Development for Enterprise Solutions contract is used to provide cyber related equipment, licenses, and support.\nVolume 2a - 118"

The mandatory (reconciliation) funds provide the initiation of Golden Dome for America requirements, including initiation of site surveys and\nland acquisition for the Southeast Radar, upgrades to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS), and increased Electronic Protection\ndevelopment efforts.  Further information for this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense System network of layered sensors provides essential situational awareness and fire control data for the command and control of Missile Defense\nSystem weapon systems, such as Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense\n(THAAD). The suite of remote ground-based sensors provides early warning, midcourse, and terminal missile defense threat data. This data enables layered detection\nand tracking of missile targets, providing fire-control quality position, velocity, and discrimination data through GMD Fire Control, or Command and Control, Battle\nManagement and Communications (C2BMC).\nOverlapping coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data, reduces the impact of the loss of any one sensor, and reduces the\npotential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces\nthe number of target engagements required, thereby conserving interceptor inventory and maintaining a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-\nbased sensors enable C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against missile threats.\nThreat discrimination improvements will enhance Missile Defense System effectiveness against the evolving adversary threat.\nThe Missile Defense System Sensors Program contributes to regional and homeland missile defense by developing, delivering, and deploying/redeploying Army Navy/\nTransportable Radar Surveillance and Control-2 (AN/TPY-2) radars for operations or tests. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate as either a THAAD Fire Unit\nRadar (terminal mode) or a Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable and add flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. Radars provide\nearly warning tracking and discrimination data through all phases of missile flight. Through the Missile Defense System C2BMC and coalition data links, the AN/TPY-2\nprovides fire control data to enable remote Standard Missile-3 engagements by Aegis BMD and to cue deployed THAAD and United States (U.S.) and partner Phased\nArray Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target batteries.\nVolume 2a - 133"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Radar Development Contract (RDC) awarded on November 1, 2017, supports the X-Band Radars (XBR). Missile Defense System capability and performance\nrequirements, which underpin continuing XBR development requirements, include, but are not limited to, the AN/TPY-2 radar and the SBX radar.  These requirements\nstem directly from formal Warfighter requirements developed in the United States Space Command-led Warfighter involvement process.  MDA's Achievable Capabilities\nList documents content from the Prioritized Capabilities List and Modification and Fielding Requirements List, which MDA then translates via the Missile Defense\nSystem architecture and system specifications into flow-down requirements, characteristics, and capability needs for individual Missile Defense System program\nspecifications and approved through the systems engineering and baseline change management process for Missile Defense System programs to execute. The RDC\nsupports the XBRs for product improvement, including developmental upgrades of software and development of hardware and software to meet enhanced capabilities\nand risk reduction measures; warfighter support, including war games and exercise support; engineering services, including engineering support for delivered and\naccepted radars to facilitate maintenance efforts which may include, but are not limited to, hardware obsolescence studies, hardware redesign, technology insertion and\nrefurbishment; Missile Defense System test subject matter expert support; modeling and simulation to support AN/TPY-2 and SBX development and assessment; and\ncybersecurity.  These support activities are for all AN/TPY-2 radars, in the Forward Based Mode and Terminal Mode, and the SBX Radar to include the Weather Air\nSearch Radar on the SBX platform.\nVolume 2a - 141"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense System Information Management Systems budget project funds information technology mission critical functions necessary for the efficient\noperations and safeguarding of Missile Defense System information in compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) policies and in keeping pace with the ever-\ngrowing cyber threat which is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face. IT is critical to the day-to-day functions of MDA personnel to\ncommunicate (classified and unclassified) with each other, Congress, senior DoD and other United States Government agency personnel, Combatant Commanders,\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, and other industry partners. Communication among these organizations facilitates the MDA mission of developing and\nfielding an integrated Missile Defense System to defend the United States, our deployed forces, allies, and friends against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all\nphases of flight.\nMDA information management systems capabilities support rigorous missile defense Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&E) and facilitate the\ndevelopment of technologies to guard against evolving missile threats. Communications are vital for missile defense to continue a viable homeland defense against\nrogue threats and to provide the integration required to defend deployed forces, allies, and friends against theater threats. Missile Defense System information\nmanagement consists of MDA Special Purpose Processing Nodes (SPPNs), IT systems, data centers, operations and monitoring centers which are vital to support the\nstrategic mission of the Agency and necessary to meet disaster recovery and continuity of operations requirements. This infrastructure is required to sustain access to\nthe Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network, MDA classified and unclassified networks, classified and unclassified video\nteleconferencing services, test and business knowledge data centers, and the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN). These mission critical functions provide\nfor the efficient operation and safeguarding of all agency information in locations supporting MDA around the world.\nProject MD30 is aligned into the following inter-agency mission critical IT services and the associated plans in accordance with the Federal Information Technology\nShared Services Strategy.\n1. End User Support.\n2. SPPNs.\n3. IT Planning and Solutions.\nVolume 2a - 239"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) program consists of system and product planning, development, integration, and operation;\nthreat model development, verification, and analysis; and integration and deployment of improved M&S capabilities. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific\nneeds of the Agency's test events and to match Missile Defense System components in their various stages of development, ranging from low-to-medium fidelity\nanalyses supporting concept definitions studies, to high-fidelity models used to support engineering level activities. MDA validates and accredits System-level models\nand simulations by anchoring them to ground and flight test events, per the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP), to enable accurate and comprehensive assessments.\nMDA's M&S systems and products provide analysis, decision-making, and planning capabilities for Real-World Operations to inform the National Command Authority,\nJoint Staff, Military Services, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Combatant Commanders (CCMDs), Operational Test Authority (OTAs), Director of Operational Test &\nEvaluation (DOT&E), and Allies.\nMDA's M&S Program executes a single, integrated, and synchronized program to manage M&S development and sustainment; improves System Flight and Ground\nTest execution and provides a digital assessment venue; leverages MDA test activities to collect data to anchor models and simulations; and supports Warfighter training\nand tactics validation.\nThe M&S program also addresses the following key elements of DOT&E assessments: Ensure that future M&S architectures are composable and flexible, and simplify\nthe integration process to conserve resources and improve capabilities; Ensure that future M&S architectures incorporate and require the use of consistent truth\nrepresentations (phenomenology, lethality, environmental factors, threat simulations, etc.); Improve cross-organizational system engineering processes to optimize\nrequirements generation and ensure the inclusion of all stakeholders; Develop refined M&S accreditation criteria between MDA and the OTA; Enable top-down systems\nengineering and management of agency-wide M&S federations.\nB.

Activities include preparation of certification and accreditation documentation and accreditation recommendations to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)\nSenior Information Assurance Officer/Certification Authority and Designated Approving Authority.  Independent Verification and Validation team actions ensure the\navailability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.  Activities are necessary to comply with the\nFederal Information Security Management Act.\nEngineering and Cyber Operations implements Risk Management Framework system engineering principles as specified within the Department of Defense (DoD)\nInstruction DoD 8510.01 to acquire, design, test, implement and field technical solutions throughout the systems architecture to ensure sufficient protections exist from\na threat and risk-based approach. MDA's goal is to ensure Cybersecurity engineering principles flow into system requirements and design specifications early to provide\nthe most cost benefit and ensure security controls are aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology 800-53a security controls as applicable to systems\ncategorized as National Security Systems.\nTechnical Intelligence Cybersecurity provides comprehensive cybersecurity risk reduction functions and services in support of both internal and external MDA\nstakeholders in order to strengthen confidence in MDA systems. This effort includes working with DIB partners to ensure protection of MDA critical information, and\nimplementation of an Agency-wide Supply Chain Risk Management program.\nThe Trusted Workforce Security program identifies, deters, and mitigates potential insider threats. These Presidentially and DoD-mandated efforts include a Counter-\nInsider Threat Program, a Personnel Security Program and a Special Security Office.\nB.

The mandatory (reconciliation) funds provide the initiation of Golden Dome for America requirements, including Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) underlay design\nand development to deliver an Aegis Combat System and containerized SM-3 as part of the expanded Homeland Defense architecture.  Further information for this\nreconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nAegis Based Defense continues development of a Sea-Based Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability in support of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) mission to\nprotect the homeland, deployed forces, friends and allies from ballistic missile threats of all ranges and in all stages of flight.\nSystems Engineering and Integration performs requirements development, engineering analysis, capability integration, and performance verification for Aegis BMD\ndevelopment and Missile Defense System integration.\nAegis BMD Technology Design and Insertion enables cross-baseline specification management and capability assessments to ensure consistent application of technical\nstandards, processes, and procedures across the Aegis BMD program.  Aegis BMD specific efforts include:  systems engineering and architecture (process and\nexecution); Modeling and Simulation (M&S); Verification and Validation (V&V) test and evaluation support; ship integration; and quality, safety, and mission assurance.\nV&V efforts in this accomplishment are performed at the Aegis BMD element level, which feed into the overall Missile Defense System level.\nAegis Baseline (BL) 5.4.1 (BMD 4.2) is a joint effort with the United States (U.S.) Navy that refurbishes existing ship AN/SPY-1 radar arrays with the installation of\nantenna Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs). As a result of cost growth and schedule delay, MDA and Navy jointly realigned the LNA program to include hardware and\nsoftware upgrades with no LNA hardware procurements. The restructured program referred to as BMD 4.1.3 will develop spiral capability for the non-LNA upgrades\nbeginning in FY 2024 to include Sea Based Terminal Increment 2 Capability Upgrade, Hypersonic Tracking and Reporting, Mission Planner Console update, and Threat\nDatabase re-architecture. This capability will deliver to 21 Flight I/II Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG) ships beginning in FY 2025.\nAegis BL 9 (BMD 5.1.5 and 5.2 (previously BMD 5.1.6)) software spiral aligns with U.S. Navy Aegis BL 9 Capability Package (CP) 2024 and Aegis BL 9.C3. The\nsoftware spiral provides enhanced detection, track, report, and defeat capabilities of additional medium, intermediate, and long-range threats with increasingly complex\nengagement scenes and increased raid sizes. Through a series of unique Capability Insertion Packages, BMD 5.X capability spirals provide continuous software\nupdates to the original BMD 5.1.0 architecture to incorporate emerging Missile Defense System capabilities, War fighter improvements, SM-3 software updates, and\nimproved Weapon System performance necessary to pace the threat. Aegis BL 9 (BMD 5.1.5 and 5.2) software spiral includes support for technology maturation and\nprototyping that will demonstrate enhanced Missile Defense tracking performance against longer range and more sophisticated threats in challenging and complex\nenvironments.\nVolume 2a - 310"

Further information for this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nProvides development of SM-3 Missiles, Upgrade Modifications, and Integration into the Aegis Weapon System and support Golden Dome for America expeditionary\nsites.\nThe SM-3 Block IB improves Aegis Based Defense ability to expand the BMD battlespace, engage longer range, more sophisticated ballistic missiles that may deploy\ncountermeasures and launch in larger raid sizes. The SM-3 Block IB Kinetic Warhead's two color infrared seeker and advanced signal processor provides a real-time\ndiscrimination and characterization capability while improving sensitivity for longer range targets. SM-3 Block IB provides capability in the exo-atmospheric region at\na reduced cost, allowing SM-3 Block IIA All-Up Rounds to attack the more complex missile threats. The SM-3 Block IB missile is a vital piece of the layered Missile\ndefense that Aegis Based Defense provide our nation.\nThe SM-3 Block IIA consists of an upgrade to a 21-inch diameter SM-3 missile and expands beyond the SM-3 Block IB battlespace to counter Intermediate Range\nBallistic Missile.  SM-3 Block IIA provides an increased kinematic envelope through improved infrared discrimination and divert capability that provide performance\nagainst the European Phased Approach phase III expanded threat set.  When combined with Aegis BMD 5.1 weapon system modifications, the SM-3 Block IIA will\nprovide Engage on Remote (EoR) capability, which allows the use of remote off board sensor information to launch and guide the SM-3 Block IIA to final intercept.\nAegis BMD 5.1 EoR capability with SM-3 Block IIA also frees up radar resources and increases the number and type of threats to be engaged simultaneously over\nprevious baselines.\nB.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Joint Warfighter Support Program (JWSP) is the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) primary means for providing direct technical support to Combatant Commands\n(CCMDs), the Military Services, and the Joint Staff on Missile Defense System development, testing, operational support, and configuration management. It enables\ndelivery of Missile Defense System capabilities to Warfighters and ensures their participation in the identification and development of new Missile Defense (MD)\ncapabilities via the Warfighter Involvement Process. The JWSP allows the Warfighter and MDA to work together to identify gaps, seams, and needs in warfighting\ncapability and enhance Missile Defense System attributes by submitting modification and fielding requests.  The JWSP administers the global asset management\nprocess ensuring Warfighters know what assets are available to support the missile defense fight. This process coordinates and deconflicts schedules to optimize\noperational availability of assets while maximizing Missile Defense System capability and meeting minimum required defense requirements.  It also provides 24 hours a\nday, 7 days a week, 365 days a year MD operational support to Warfighters worldwide, to include global system verification and validation over the operational Common\nInteractive Broadcast.  The program enables rapid response to Warfighter Requests for Information and Requests for Analyses, which are especially critical to mission\nsuccess in protecting U.S. Forces and other defended assets during Real World threat events. The program also supports improving products delivered to Warfighters\nthrough technical reviews and technical analyses supporting strategic and regional MD planning, development of shot doctrine and MD design.  The JWSP also enables\nthe inclusion of both CCMD and MDA MD objectives in CCMD/Joint Staff-sponsored Wargames and Exercises, which are used to sharpen and enhance joint MD\nwarfighting skills.  Finally, the JWSP administers all Navy Reserve support personnel and handles coordination for Army, Air Force and Space Force Reserve that\nprovide technical, engineering, intelligence, integration, and operational support to the MDA.\nVolume 2a - 439"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe MDA - U.S. Israeli Cooperative Program Office jointly manages the Arrow Program with Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) to ensure that all systems\nare delivered with quality, on time, on budget, and meet the needs of the warfighter. The program funding is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel with Israel\nproviding matching contributions. However, a portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint\nprogram initiation. Contracts are awarded by IMDO or MDA, dependent on what is most advantageous to the Joint Governments. In regard to AWS, IMDO contracts\non behalf of U.S. government with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies. For the ITB, the MDA contracts directly with Elbit\nSystems, Ltd. while IMDO provides an equitable share of the funding to the U.S. Finally, MDA provides funding and contracts directly with WALES, Ltd. for the ISA&I\nprogram.\nVolume 2a - 541"

Further information about this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) utilizes a disciplined system engineering process to develop and integrate the Missile Defense System into an effective, layered defense\nagainst ballistic missiles of all ranges during all phases of flight. This process consists of the following steps: Plan, Define, Design, Build, Test and Verify, Assess, and\nDeliver Missile Defense System Capability, followed by transfer of selected capabilities. The Missile Defense System Test Program Element is responsible for testing\nthat provides critical data to: determine validity of models and simulations used to verify and assess Missile Defense System capabilities; validate that Elements and\nComponents are properly designed, built, and integrated; and provide confidence that the Missile Defense System will perform as designed.  Results from the Test and\nVerify step provide feedback into the Plan, Define, and Design steps to identify areas for system improvements. Key to the systems engineering process is Modeling\nand Simulation (M&S), which reflects the integrated operational system's performance. Confidence in M&S is based on a comprehensive Verification, Validation, and\nAccreditation process. The Missile Defense System Test Program, as documented in the IMTP, has a primary emphasis to provide the data necessary to verify and\nassess Missile Defense System capabilities in support of Technical Capability Declarations, and to anchor Missile Defense System M&S.  As models are validated and\naccredited, MDA and the Missile Defense System Operational Test Agency Team will utilize these models to assess Missile Defense System capabilities through a\ncampaign of ground testing.\nMissile Defense System Test Program Functions include:\n- Represent MDA as the single test authority to the test and evaluation community, international cooperative program representatives, and other organization\nrepresentatives.\n- Develop and implement MDA test policy, standards, tools, products, and processes to enable effective tests while balancing MDA and element programmatic needs.\n- Develop an IMTP that compiles all MDA test objectives, test schedules, and funding requirements from the year of execution through the Future Years Defense\nProgram time period and beyond.\n- Act as the single point of contact in MDA for all external ranges and common test resources.\nVolume 2a - 553"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Missile Defense System Test Program acquisition strategy is consistent with the MDA capabilities-based acquisition strategy that emphasizes testing, evolutionary\nacquisition, and knowledge-based funding. Test directs a team of various internal staff (government and scientific, engineering and technical assistance support),\nexecuting agents including the DoD agencies, Service Organizations, Laboratories and Program Offices, Federally Funded Research and Development Center and\nother MDA programs to execute the various diverse efforts within the Missile Defense System test program through competition. When a specific effort/activity being\nconducted, acquired, or maintained requires the use of an executing agent, respective headquarter regulations are used to conform the acquisition strategy.\nThe MDA IMTP establishes and documents the test requirements for the Missile Defense System with the specific focus on collecting the data needed for the\nVerification, Validation, and Accreditation of the Missile Defense System M&S. This paradigm uses critical factor analysis to drive test design, planning, and execution\nfor accrediting M&S, which is used to validate and assess system performance. With this test approach, MDA will establish confidence that the M&S used to evaluate the\nMissile Defense System represent real world behavior, thereby enabling simulation-based performance assessment to verify system functionality.\nVolume 2a - 563"

The mandatory (reconciliation) funds provide the initiation of Target enhancement requirements and long lead hardware.  Further information for this\nreconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe mission of the Missile Defense System Targets Program is to provide an economical and reliable inventory of targets that are representative of feasible future\nthreats. These targets enable demonstration of Missile Defense System capabilities in operationally realistic scenarios. The Missile Defense System Targets Program\ndevelops and acquires five target types across four target classes. The classes include: Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM), Medium Range Ballistic Missiles\n(MRBM), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The target types (Type 1-5) designate the complexity of the target\nwithin its class. Type-1 (T1) targets are simple baseline configurations. Type-2 (T2) targets have increased capability or complexity. Type-3 (T3) targets have unique\nconfigurations.  Type-4 (T4) targets are subscale targets. Type-5 (T5) targets are advanced targets.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program develops and provides Modified Ballistic Re-Entry Vehicles (MBRV) and Countermeasures that can be used across\nthe spectrum of target types and classes. The Missile Defense System Targets Program provides target digital models that enable the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)\nweapon system program offices to simulate end to end sensor and interceptor performance during pre-mission analysis. The Missile Defense System Targets Program\nalso provides maintenance, aging surveillance, refurbishment, and routine testing of government furnished equipment boosters and target components.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program carefully plans the year of execution to assure the best use of appropriated funds.  However, the Missile Defense System\nTargets Program must be flexible in its execution of the program in order to respond to emerging real world threats or changes in the intelligence community estimates of\nwhen a threat will be deployed.  The Missile Defense System Targets Program must also work with missile defense systems engineers on a continuing basis to align the\ntargets program to the Missile Defense System need to demonstrate capabilities as reflected in the Missile Defense System IMTP.  The Missile Defense System Targets\nProgram makes every effort to reduce instability in contracts, production base and budget while managing in this dynamic work environment.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program develops and builds targets and countermeasures at multiple locations including:  Orlando, FL; Huntsville, AL; and\nChandler, AZ. Storage and maintenance facilities are also located throughout the country including:  Huntsville, AL; White Sands, NM; Ogden, UT; Tooele, UT; and\nCape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program consists of four major areas: Consumables, Program Planning and Operations, Resources, and Flight Test Execution.\nVolume 2a - 612"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program delivers targets and countermeasures for Missile Defense System flight-testing to counter evolving threats. Program\nrequirements are derived from the Missile Defense System IMTP and from multiple Target System Performance Specifications (TSPS).\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program is currently in various acquisition and contracting stages to deliver targets and countermeasures per multiple TSPS by\ntarget class: SRBM, MRBM, IRBM, and ICBM.  Each target class may be independently solicited, evaluated, and competitively awarded based on the IMTP 'need date'\npriority order.  The Targets Program also delivers countermeasures based on requirements and TSPS.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2011 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) with a Period of\nPerformance (PoP) of March 2011 through December 2025 for air-launched IRBM targets.  This award included two follow-on options, one for eight (8) IRBM targets\nexercised in 2014 and another for six (6) IRBM targets exercised in 2017.  Two (2) IRBM targets were added on the contract in 2018 to support the Missile Defense\nSystem Acceleration efforts.  This contract also included the development and delivery of ICBM targets.  The contract scope included two ICBM Stage Zero Retrofit Kits\nto be installed in existing air-launched IRBM targets.  Four (4) ICBM Stage Zero Kits were added in 2018.  A contract modification for a nine (9) month PoP extension\nis expected to be awarded before the end of 2Q FY25 to ensure completion of flight test support for a mission occurring at the end of the current contract PoP.  A new\ncontract is expected to be awarded in 4Q FY25, but not later than 2Q FY26, for the flight test support on the remaining IRBM/ICBM targets in inventory.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2016 to NGSC with a PoP of July 2016 to December 2020 for three MRBM\nT3c2 targets.  This award included options for up to four (4) MRBM T3c2 targets.  In August 2020 a modification was awarded to extend the base contract through March\n2024 to account for two flight tests scheduled for FY23 and FY24.  FTM-31 E1a was successfully executed in 2QFY23. Due to the FTM-32 Best Estimated Test Date\n(BETD) delay, the contract PoP was extended to 30 September 2024. The final mission was successfully executed in 2Q FY24. The contract is currently undergoing final\ncloseout.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2013 to L-3 Communications/Coleman Aerospace Corporation (Now L3\nHarris) with a PoP of October 2013 through October 2023 to provide six (6) MRBM targets.  Six (6) additional targets were added to the contract in 2019 to incorporate\nadditional IMTP requirements and extended the contract PoP through December 2027.  The option for the third lot of six (6) additional targets was also added to the\ncontract in 1Q FY23 and the PoP was extended to December 2029. The first three (3) targets from this contract have been successfully launched and the fourth is due\n1Q FY25.   A new contract will be awarded by 1Q FY30 for the flight test support on the remaining targets in inventory.\nVolume 2a - 621"

This T4 Subscale contract has a base quantity of four (4) SRBMs, five (5) MRBMs, with options for up to seventeen (17)  SRBMs and\nseven (7) MRBMs.  All three available one year options have been exercised resulting in a current PoP end date of September 2027.  In July 2023, a modification was\nawarded to add five (5) Modified Ballistic Re-entry Vehicle-11 (MBRV-11).  The first target from this contract is on track to be launched in 4Q FY25.\nThe T4-B, T4-E, and T4-G Targets and other legacy Aegis Readiness Assessment Vehicles targets are acquired through the Naval Surface Warfare Center Port\nHueneme Division White Sands (NSWC PHD WS) via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) funding transactions.  NSWC PHD WS has unique\nSounding Rocket expertise and access to existing contracts that makes this a beneficial relationship for both parties.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program also acquires SRBM subscale targets (Black Dagger and Zombie) with special guidance requirements through MIPRs\nfrom the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2017 to Lockheed Martin (LM) with a base PoP of November 2017 through\nDecember 2022 for the Modified Ballistic Re-Entry Vehicles/Re-Entry Vehicles Separation Modules -7/-8 Configuration 2 (MBRV/RVSM -7/-8 C2) systems.  In December\n2021, the PoP was extended to January 2027.  This action also moved from delivery of in-line missionization hardware to delivery of hardware that has been configured\nto a generic configuration.  Based on this concept, missionization will occur once a mission has been identified in the IMTP.  This effort currently requires the delivery of\nthree (3) MBRV-7 C2 and five (5) MBRV-8 C2 targets, with options for two (2) MBRV-7 C2 and five (5) MBRV-8 C2 targets, as set forth in the IMTP.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program awarded a sole source contract in 2013 to LM with a base PoP of January 2014 through September 2016.  The Program\nOffice awarded a contract modification to the Targets and Countermeasures Highly Specialized Services (TCHSS) contract that extended the PoP through September\n2027.  This effort provides missionization requirements-preparation and flight readiness of target assets, ordnance handling, and execution of mission reviews to support\nspecific flight-test objectives for MBRVs.\nThe TCHSS and MBRV C2 contracts will be ending in 2027.  In order to support IMTP missions for 2027 and beyond, a new contract will be awarded in 2026 to support\nmissionization, re-missionization options, storage, logistics, routine maintenance functions on all MBRV hardware and associated support equipment, and options for\nMBRV modifications.\nThe Hypersonic Target Vehicle (HTV)-2 prototyping program was transitioned from John Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Physics Lab (APL) to Sandia National\nLaboratory (SNL) in April 2024.  Due to previous Congressional plus up funding and United States Air Force (USAF) technology maturation efforts, the SNL Advanced\nTarget Configuration-2 (ATFE c2) emerged as a viable alternative material solution that would meet IMTP flight testing requirements with lower cost, schedule, and\ntechnical risk. The current HTV-2 acquisition strategy is a collaborative effort between MDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to mature the SNL ATFE c2\ntechnology to meet AFRL test bed and MDA HTV-2 target requirements.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program future acquisition planning and solicitations will go through MDA Acquisition Strategy Panel(s)/Board(s) for decision-\nmaking.  Future acquisition strategies are based on three (3) premises: a) utilize existing capabilities/infrastructure and sustain an industrial base to deliver targets;\nVolume 2a - 622"

Decrease in discretionary funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026 is due to higher agency priorities.  Further information\nfor this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThis program develops a Missile Defense System for the Defense of Guam (DoG) against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats as a high priority mission for\nthe Department of Defense.  The Missile Defense System will form a key part of strategic deterrence and supports the PDI.\nIn FY 2022, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) initiated studies and analysis, architecture development and siting analysis. FY 2023 continued architecture development\nand increased the development and modification of the distributed radar, Aegis Guam System support, environmental studies, site design, activation and advanced\nplanning. In FY 2024, the program leveraged the results of studies and analysis to continue developing and fielding of distributed land-based launchers, distributed\nsensors, and integrated communications across Guam. The acquisition approach is to balance costs and associated risks in order to provide increased Aegis Weapon\nSystem development for Guam integration, site activation, environmental protection, engineering, and interoperability. FY 2025 continues the advancements of FY 2024\ncompleting an on-island flight experiment in early FY 2025, continued Environmental Studies and Mitigations, and continuation of the software development phase for\nthe Aegis and Radar components.\nThe activities in FY 2026 include development and integration efforts between MDA, United States (U.S.) Army (USA), U.S. Navy (USN), and U.S. Air Force (USAF)\nsystems, which includes a 360 degree persistent integrated air and missile defense Aegis Guam System with distributed Mk-41 Vertical Launching Systems, and a\nsingle Tactical Array Unit (TAU) Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control-6 (AN/TPY-6) and missile uplink/downlink communications system for the\nDoG.  Aegis Guam System will develop capability to leverage track data from Army systems, that is provided via the Joint Track Management Capability - Bridge (JTMC-\nB), to support Standard Missile-6 Engage on Remote (EoR) capability. The Guam Architecture will be commanded and controlled from the Joint Command Center with\nadditional Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System; Aegis Guam System; Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications mission\nVolume 2a - 655"

The mandatory funds development efforts for operationalizing of the Initial Deployment of Aegis Guam System (Flight Experimental Mission - 02) Leave\nBehind) in the new Guam Defense System architecture. Decrease in discretionary funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026 is due to higher agency priorities.  Further information\nfor this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThis program develops a Missile Defense System for the Defense of Guam (DoG) against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats as a high priority mission for\nthe Department of Defense.  The Missile Defense System will form a key part of strategic deterrence and supports the PDI.\nIn FY 2022, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) initiated studies and analysis, architecture development and siting analysis. FY 2023 continued architecture development\nand increased the development and modification of the distributed radar, Aegis Guam System support, environmental studies, site design, activation and advanced\nplanning.  In FY 2024, the program leveraged the results of studies and analysis and continued developing and fielding of distributed land-based launchers, distributed\nsensors, and integrated communications across Guam. The acquisition approach is to balance costs and associated risks in order to provide increased Aegis Weapon\nSystem development for Guam integration, site activation, environmental protection, engineering, and interoperability. FY 2025 continues the advancements of FY\n2024, with the completion of an on-island flight experiment in early FY 2025, continued Environmental Studies and Mitigations, and the continuation of the software\ndevelopment phase of the Aegis and Radar components.\nThe activities in FY 2026 include development and integration efforts between MDA, United States (U.S.) Army (USA), U.S. Navy (USN), and U.S. Air Force (USAF)\nsystems, which includes a 360 degree persistent integrated air and missile defense Aegis Guam System with distributed Mk-41 Vertical Launching Systems, and\na single Tactical Array Unit (TAU) Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control-6 (AN/TPY-6) and missile uplink/downlink communications system for\nthe DoG. Aegis Guam System will develop capability to leverage track data from Army systems, that is provided via the Joint Track Management Capability - Bridge\n(JTMC-B), to support Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) Engage on Remote (EoR) capability. The Guam Architecture will be commanded and controlled from the Joint\nCommand Center with additional Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System; Aegis Guam System; Command and Control, Battle Management and\nCommunications mission node and Tactical Operations Center - Light providing local continuity of operations.  Initial Aegis Guam System capability was demonstrated\non Guam in calendar year (CY) 2024. Aegis Guam System with additional Terminal Defense capability will be delivered in CY 2029.\nB.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions, Article Quantities in Each) FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026\nDescription: Develop and deliver a defensive capability to engage and defeat regional hypersonic threats during the glide\nphase of flight using the proven Aegis Weapon System as the point of departure for missile employment. This will provide an\nadditional layer of regional hypersonic defense from an Aegis ship, virtualized Aegis platform, or other fire control solution;\nwhich also complements the Sea-Based Terminal capability by extending the battlespace.  The defensive capability includes the\ndevelopment of a Glide Phase Interceptor missile that reduces the operational seam currently used by hypersonic threats to fly\nbetween air defense and ballistic missile defense systems.  The effort also includes updates to the Aegis Weapon System for\nplanning, tracking and conducting remote engagements against hypersonic threats within the Missile Defense System as well\nas conducting studies and advancing hypersonic capability to legacy Aegis Weapon Systems and future launch and fire control\nsystems. It also includes urgently producing and fielding hypersonic defense capabilities. These capabilities developed based on\nthe starting point of the proven Aegis Weapon System will be adaptable to non ship-based platforms as they are developed.  This\naccomplishment will perform Systems Engineering, architecture analysis, modeling and simulation (M&S), advanced hypersonic\ntechnology development, and integrate the new capability into the Missile Defense System.\nRecurring accomplishments:\nRegional Glide Phase Interceptor Missile\n- Development of feasibility data which supports missile subassembly requirement development.\n- Conduct missile legacy component assessments to support the initial concept design that will house and use the legacy\ncomponents. Mission Assurance data is required to justify the operating environments the legacy components will be in and any\nmodifications necessary to support the Glide Phase Interceptor mission.\n- Conduct element-level M&S development to lay the foundation of the design and ensure early subassembly design concepts\nsupport integrated missile performance to the Glide Phase Interceptor requirements.\n- Continue development and maturation of Critical Technology Elements across limited areas of the all up round.\n- Execute design activities for hardware, software, support systems, human interfaces, cybersecurity, and mechanical and\nelectrical interfaces.\n- Purchase limited materials to support proof of design and design verification testing in support of establishing the preliminary\ninterceptor design.\n- Conduct hypersonic threat development and lethality development.\n- Conducted international cooperative development through agreements between United States and Japan.\n- Explore capability against multi-mission threats.\n- Integrate Glide Phase Intercept into Golden Dome communication architecture.\nAegis Weapon System\n- Mature design concepts and models as needed to incorporate and evolve ship board Aegis Weapon System upgrades and\ninterceptor integration activities for hypersonic engagements.\nVolume 2a - 703"

The mandatory funds provide for the Next Generation Interceptor booster development to maintain development schedule for initial\noperational capability in FY 2028. Further information for this reconciliation request is provided in Section 20003 (Missile Defense) of the Reconciliation Exhibit.\nDecrease in discretionary funds from FY 2025 to FY 2026 reflects an adjustment of major developmental and design maturation activities leading to the Next Generation\nInterceptor All Up Round (AUR) Critical Design Review (CDR), and the transition to qualification activities and flight test preparation.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Improved Homeland Defense Interceptors provides the development, integration, and testing of a Next Generation Interceptor AUR consisting of an integrated boost\nvehicle/multiple kill vehicle payload capable of surviving both natural and hostile environments while countering the allocated threat space.  Meeting the United States\nNorthern Command's (USNORTHCOM) Operational Needs for Homeland Defense.\nThe Next Generation Interceptor will provide USNORTHCOM a solution that is lethal across the specified threat space; upgradeable to address future and advancing\nthreats; and fully integrated into the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Weapon System (GWS). The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) issued a Request for\nProposal in FY 2020 and competitively awarded two best value contracts on March 24, 2021, for a Next Generation Interceptor acquisition. The MDA maintained the\ncompetitive environment through Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR) and Knowledge Point (KP) 1 in FY 2024 to reduce technical risk, encourage schedule acceleration,\nand support the Department's ability to field a system capable of negating the expanding threat. With the PDR/KP #1 data, the MDA selected a single Prime contractor\nfor continued development through a CDR; qualification; integration with the GWS; ground cyber and flight testing; and AUR production.\nRapidly evolving rogue and peer missile threats have led to a change in national defense policy.  The President's January 27, 2025, Executive Order established a goal\nof protecting the United States (U.S.) citizens, safeguarding critical infrastructure, and securing second-strike capability against missile attack from any adversary.  The\nMDA is responding with speed and intensity to deliver next-generation missile defenses to protect the U.S. against ballistic, hypersonic, cruise, and other advanced\nmissile threats.  This program submission reflects changes necessary to meet this evolving mission space.\nVolume 2a - 753"

The MDA competitively awarded two best value contracts for the Next Generation Interceptor to Northrop Grumman\n(previously known as Next Generation Interceptor Gold Program) and Lockheed Martin (previously known as Next Generation Interceptor Black Program) in March\n2021. Each Contractor's design development and component testing led to completion of a PDR and KP #1, which provided significant risk reduction and confidence\nfor MDA.  With the PDR/KP #1 data, the MDA selected Lockheed Martin for continued development through a CDR, qualification, integration with the GMD Weapon\nSystem, ground and flight testing, and AUR production. MDA established future KPs and ground and flight tests to evaluate Next Generation Interceptor and GMD\nWeapon System performance supporting future production decisions.\nThe Next Generation Interceptor efforts include, but are not limited to, systems engineering; hardware, software, and firmware development; manufacturing; integration\nand checkout; testing; and delivery of Next Generation Interceptors, culminating in an initial campaign of four intercept flight tests. Based on successful capability\ndemonstration during multiple flight tests, MDA will seek progressive approvals from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to proceed with\nprocurement of operational AURs.\nA contract option is available to extend efforts through December 2030 for activities and hardware to support Missile Defense System Ground Testing, as well as\nactivities and hardware to deliver up to ten (10) Next Generation Interceptor units in an integrated AUR configuration to support the corresponding Missile Defense\nSystem Flight Test campaigns. Contemporaneous with KP #1, the two Next Generation Interceptor contractors submitted not-to-exceed cost estimates for an additional\ntest article and 20 production units, broken into two production lots. The Next Generation Interceptor contractor is required to deliver a firm production proposal at CDR.\nThe Next Generation Interceptor competitive acquisition strategy met its intended goals for the technology development phase to reduce technical risk, encourage\nschedule acceleration, and support the Department's ability to field a system capable of negating the expanding threat.\nIn addition to the Next Generation Interceptor Contract, GMD's overarching Acquisition Strategy includes a GWS Contract and Systems Integration, Test, and Readiness\n(SITR) Contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for Missile Defense System incremental delivery. Each contract is structured to break out\nmajor efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nOther Enabling GMD Acquisition Strategies (budgeted for in PE 0603882C):\nThe GWS Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to design, develop, produce, and test the upgrades to the GWS.\nIn addition, the GWS Contract included the sustainment planning, and maintenance of the currently fielded GMD Weapon System. The GWS contractor is responsible\nfor developing weapon system solutions, including fire control and communication systems improvements, required to update the legacy system to remain effective\nwhile the Next Generation Interceptor is under development, as well as, preparing for the seamless introduction of Next Generation Interceptor and other future Missile\nDefense System capabilities. The GWS contractor will incorporate the interface updates adding the  Next Generation Interceptors to the fleet, provide USNORTHCOM\nVolume 2a - 759"

The SITR contractor\nis the Government's partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System alongside USNORTHCOM. While the Government maintains\noverall weapon system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR contractor assumes a supporting role aiding with GMD Weapon System integration, GMD\ncontributions to Missile Defense System enterprise level integration, and GMD requirements verification.\nThe GMD Boost Vehicle Sustainment Contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021 and the Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle Sustainment Contract\nwas awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems in June 2023. The Ground Based Interceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award to The Boeing Company\nin FY 2025. These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until the replacement Next Generation Interceptors are fielded. These Contractors perform\nInterceptor Fleet management consisting of service life extensions, maintaining the existing fleet, and executing repairs.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and project offices.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Aegis Based Defense mission is to deliver an enduring, operationally effective and supportable Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability to defend the nation,\ndeployed forces, friends and allies, and to increase this capability by delivering evolutionary improvements as part of Missile Defense System upgrades. The Aegis\nBased Defense element of the Missile Defense System capitalizes upon and evolves from the existing United States (U.S.) Navy Aegis Weapon System and Standard\nMissile (SM) infrastructures. Aegis Based Defense provides a forward-deployable, mobile capability to detect and track Ballistic Missiles of all ranges, and the ability to\ndestroy Short-Range Ballistic Missiles, Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles, and Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles in the midcourse phase of flight, and shorter range\nmissiles in the terminal phase of flight. Aegis Based Defense also provides a Long Range Surveillance and Track capability to the Missile Defense System. Upgrades\nto both the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the SM-3 configuration enable Aegis Based Defense to provide effective, supportable defensive capability against longer\nrange, threats and an enduring Aegis Ashore defensive capability.\nThis Program Element works with all U.S. Armed Services that participate in the Missile Defense System level Operational Test Agency Team. With the support of the\nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a test program to improve confidence in missile defense capabilities\nunder development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the warfighter are operationally effective, suitable, and survivable. As part of the MDA's rigorous test\nprogram, System Pre-Flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. System Post-Flight\nReconstruction replicates the Missile Defense System configuration, actual environmental conditions, and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor Modeling and\nSimulation results. The IMTP is event-oriented and extends until the collection of all identified data is completed ensuring adequate test investments.\nVolume 2a - 793"

Aegis Based Defense hardware and software are integrated into existing Aegis Weapon System baselines, Standard Missile (SM)-3 interceptor, and Navy's\nSM-6 interceptor.\nThe Missile Defense Agency (MDA) works with the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Navy's Operational Test and Evaluation Force, industry partners,\nand the Navy Warfare Centers in the designing, planning, safety, readiness, execution, data collection, pre-mission and post-mission analysis, and reporting. The system\npre-flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. The system post-flight reconstruction\nreplicates the Missile Defense System configuration, actual environmental conditions, and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor Modeling and Simulation\n(M&S) results.  Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense participation in Hardware-in-the-Loop and integrated MDA level ground tests supports the operational capability fielding\ndecisions.\nB.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThis program supports development of the Land-Based Standard Missile-3 capability, Aegis Ashore. On 17 September 2009, the President announced an overarching\nplan to provide regional missile defense to United States (U.S.) deployed forces, allies, and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA).\nThe EPAA policy specifically defines a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of\nthese land-based capabilities.\nAegis Ashore is a key component of EPAA Phases II (Romania) and III (Poland) and provides Aegis BMD capability against short to intermediate-range ballistic\nmissiles in an ashore configuration. Aegis Ashore provides sophisticated engagement strategies and can adapt to threat updates within each sites designated area of\nresponsibility.  Aegis Ashore re-hosts the required BMD components of a U.S. Navy Destroyer, including: Army/Navy Surface Radar Surveillance and Control Radar;\nVertical Launch System, Computing Infrastructure; Command and Control; Communications; Computers and Intelligence Systems; and Operator Consoles.\nAegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex operates as a test asset that continues to inform Aegis Weapon System and Aegis Combat System developmental efforts,\nintegration of hardware and software upgrades and modernization efforts, and analyzing real time anomalies experienced in testing and in operational scenarios.\nVolume 2a - 835"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe GMD program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development. The GMD acquisition strategy\nensures GMD products are upgraded to improve GMD Weapon System performance to meet Warfighter requirements and defeat the allocated threats. This acquisition\napproach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability improvements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost, schedule, and\nperformance while rapidly delivering improved operational and technological capabilities.\nGMD's overarching Acquisition Strategy includes a Next Generation Interceptor Contract, Ground Based Interceptor sustainment contracts, a GMD Weapon System\n(GWS) Contract, and a System Integration, Test, and Readiness (SITR) Contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for Missile Defense System\nincremental delivery. Each of the contracts is structured to break out major efforts into separate CLINs with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and\nproperty accountability.\nThe GMD overarching acquisition strategy included a competitive source selection to develop and test an integrated Next Generation All Up Round (AUR) interceptor\nto meet Warfighter requirements and defeat the allocated threats. The MDA competitively awarded two best value contracts for the Next Generation Interceptor to\nNorthrop Grumman (previously known as Next Generation Interceptor Gold Program) and Lockheed Martin (previously known as Next Generation Interceptor Black\nProgram) in March 2021. Each Contractor's design development and component testing led to completion of a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Knowledge Point\n(KP) #1, which provided significant risk reduction and confidence for MDA. With the PDR/KP #1 data, the MDA selected Lockheed Martin for continued development\nVolume 2a - 867"

MDA established future\nKPs and ground and flight tests to evaluate Next Generation Interceptor and GMD Weapon System performance supporting future production decisions. A contract\noption is available to extend efforts through December 2028 for activities and hardware to support Missile Defense System Ground Testing, as well as activities and\nhardware to deliver up to ten (10) Next Generation Interceptor units in an integrated AUR configuration to support the corresponding Missile Defense System Flight\nTest campaigns. Contemporaneous with KP #1, the two Next Generation Interceptor contractors submitted not-to-exceed cost estimates for an additional test article\nand 20 production units, broken into two production lots. The Next Generation Interceptor contractor is required to deliver a firm production proposal at CDR. The Next\nGeneration Interceptor competitive acquisition strategy met its intended goals for the technology development phase to reduce technical risk, encourage schedule\nacceleration, and support the Department's ability to field a system capable of negating the expanding threat.\nThe GWS Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to design, develop, produce, and test the upgrades to the\nGMD Weapon System. In addition, the GWS Contract included the sustainment planning, and maintenance of the currently fielded GMD Weapon System. The\nGWS contractor is responsible for developing weapon system solutions, including fire control and communication systems improvements, required to update the\nlegacy system to remain effective while the Next Generation Interceptor is under development, as well as, preparing for the seamless introduction of Next Generation\nInterceptor and other future Missile Defense System capabilities.  The GWS contractor will incorporate the interface updates adding the  Next Generation Interceptors\nto the fleet, provide United States Northern Command the  capability to operate the GMD Weapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next\nGeneration Interceptors, and identify and develop solutions for message exchanges between the GMD Weapon System and in-flight payloads, all while maintaining a\nrobust cyber defense network capable of detecting and defending against current and future cybersecurity threats.\nThe GMD SITR Contract was competitively awarded to The Boeing Company on September 1, 2022 to support the MDA as the GMD Weapon System Integrator by\nproviding  a synergistic approach in executing the GMD engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the integrated GMD Weapon System. The SITR contractor\nis the Government's partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System alongside USNORTHCOM. While the Government maintains\noverall weapon system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR contractor assumes a supporting role aiding with GMD Weapon System integration, GMD\ncontributions to Missile Defense System enterprise level integration, and GMD requirements verification.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and project offices. With a focus to achieve Small Business goals, MDA is leveraging existing MDA Consolidated Support\ncontracts and will utilize MDA competitively awarded new contracts to acquire Fiscal Years 2020-2030 Advisory and Assistance Services support.\nOther Enabling GMD Acquisition Strategies (budgeted for in Program Element 0603882C).\nThe GMD Boost Vehicle Sustainment Contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021 and the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Sustainment Contract was\nawarded to Raytheon Missile Systems in June 2023.  The Ground Based Interceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award to The Boeing Company\nin FY 2025. These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until the replacement Next Generation Interceptors are fielded. These Contractors perform\nInterceptor Fleet management consisting of service life extensions, maintaining the existing fleet, and executing repairs.\nVolume 2a - 868"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nSKA: The SKA project will deliver dedicated space sensors contributing to hit and kill assessment for Homeland Defense. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Missile\nDefense System intercept testing experience provided a solid understanding of kill assessment physics to enable exploration of this critical capability. SKA incorporates\nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations to examine the operational feasibility of disaggregating large satellites and to provide data for the business\ncase for shared versus dedicated satellite control, including the ground antenna networks. The favorable cost and schedule performance on SKA is also consistent with\nthe GAO's assessment of hosted payload programs. The SKA experiment utilizes a network of small infrared sensors integrated onto host satellites that while on orbit\nobserve missile defense intercepts and deliver situational awareness hit and kill assessment declarations.\nHypersonic & Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS):  HBTSS will demonstrate a schedule-focused, cost-constrained capability to detect and track hypersonic threats\nand boosting conventional ballistic missiles. The key characteristic of the HBTSS prototype demonstration that sets it apart from other Overhead Persistent Infrared\nsensors is the requirement to provide fire-control quality tracking data. The enhanced tracking accuracy through missile burn out on ballistic threats and the enhanced\ntracking accuracy on hypersonic threats will provide the warfighter increased missile defense weapons systems engagement capability and higher accuracy impact\npredictions.  The requirement for fire-control data necessitates that HBTSS be a highly sensitive, low-latency, high quality of service system. Following the successful\ndemonstration of HBTSS capabilities, the responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the United States Space Force and the MDA will continue\nthe development of the next-generation of space-based fire control sensors for missile defense. Operationally, the HBTSS fire-control capability will be part of Space\nDevelopment Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture and will detect hypersonic, ballistic, and other advanced threats much sooner than terrestrial radars,\nproviding hypersonic threat-tracking data for hand off through linked missile defense weapons.\nVolume 2a - 899"

The core MDSEA platform was previously funded by SKA and HBTSS; program unique requirements will continue to be funded by the\nindividual programs.  The decrease also reflects transitioning from on-orbit operations to de-orbit operations for the Hypersonic & Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor\n(HBTSS) prototype demonstration Space Vehicle.\nA. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nHBTSS will demonstrate a resilient, flexible, and global capability to detect and track hypersonic missiles and detect and track ballistic missiles in the boost phase of\nflight. The fire-control quality tracking data will allow long range engagement of the threat while enhanced tracking accuracy through missile burn out will provide the\nWarfighting community increased capability in missile defense weapons systems engagement and higher accuracy impact predictions.\nThe HBTSS prototype demonstration's priority is to maintain the pace of the development schedule given the urgent Warfighter need to address rapidly developing\nthreats. To meet this priority, HBTSS must use high technology readiness level components, take advantage of existing government capabilities to minimize\ndevelopment, use a management culture that does not slow down the pace of development, and use the Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to minimize contracting\ncycle times. OTAs allow the government to work with traditional, non-traditional, and new space businesses to identify and implement innovative solutions.\nThe HBTSS prototype demonstration seeks to demonstrate the ability to meet requirements derived from United States Strategic Command Prioritized Capabilities\nList, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Capability Development Document for Missile Warning\n(MW)/Missile Defense (MD) Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR).\nThe HBTSS developed target detection algorithms and evaluated them in a Signal-chain Processing Demonstration, providing insight into the constellation architecture,\ncommunications approach, and preliminary command and control design aspects.  These results informed the development of the HBTSS prototype demonstration\nSpace Vehicles (SVs) and demonstrated the ability to detect and track dim targets in a cluttered background along with the sensitivity necessary to support the\nhypersonic kill chain.\nOperationally, the HBTSS fire-control capability will be part of Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture and will detect hypersonic,\nballistic, and other advanced threats much sooner than terrestrial radars, providing hypersonic threat-tracking data for hand off through linked missile defense weapons.\nVolume 2a - 914"

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions, Article Quantities in Each) FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026\nDecrease from FY 2025 to FY 2026 reflects the consolidation of funding from SKA and HBTSS to Space Applications for Missile\nDefense for the MDSEA platform which provides ground segment support across the Missile Defense System Space Programs\nenterprise. The core MDSEA platform was previously funded by SKA and HBTSS; program unique requirements will continue to\nbe funded by the individual programs.  The decrease also reflects transitioning from on-orbit operations to de-orbit operations for\nthe HBTSS prototype demonstration Space Vehicle.\nAccomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 69.501 76.027 57.199\nC.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe HBTSS acquisition approach uses a phased approach to develop a warfighting capability. Each phase has a limited duration, is capability focused, and allows\nHBTSS to maintain schedule, reduce risk, and add new technology and capabilities when ready. The current acquisition phase consists of competitive prototyping\nwith multiple performers utilizing the OTAs. The current phase has resulted in the launch of the prototype demonstration SVs which will perform a two-year on-orbit\ndemonstration period to test, characterize, and validate HBTSS performance.  Following the successful demonstration of HBTSS capabilities, the responsibility for\nHBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the U.S. Space Force and the MDA will continue the development of the next-generation of space-based fire control\nsensors for missile defense.\nVolume 2a - 916"

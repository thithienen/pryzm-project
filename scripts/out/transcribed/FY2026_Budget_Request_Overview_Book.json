      "text": "Preface \nThe Overview Book has been published as part of the President’s Annual Defense Budget since \nFY 2009.  From FY 1969 to FY 2005, OSD published the “Annual Defense Report” (ADR) to meet \n10 USC section 113 requirements.  Subsequently, the Overview began to fill this role.   \nThe Overview is one part of an extensive set of materials that constitute the presentation and \njustification of the President’s Budget for FY 2026.  This document and all other publications for \nthis and previous DoD budgets are available from the public website of the Under Secretary of \nDefense (Comptroller):  https://comptroller.defense.gov.   \nThe Press Release and Budget Briefing, often referred to as the “Budget Rollout,” and the \nProgram Acquisition Costs by Weapons System book, which includes summary details on major \nDoD acquisition programs (i.e., aircraft, ground forces programs, shipbuildi ng, space systems, \netc.), are especially relevant.   \nNotable accomplishments and updates will be summarized in the forthcoming 2024 Annual \nPerformance Report (APR).  Unclassified versions of the Annual Performance Plan (APP) and \nAPR will be posted at https://dam.defense.gov/Performance-Mgmt/ when available. \nOther background information can be accessed at www.defense.gov. \n \n \nThe estimated cost of this report or study \nfor the Department of Defense is \napproximately $42,000 for the 2025 \nFiscal Year. This includes $11,000 in \nexpenses and $31,000 in DoD labor. \n  \nGenerated on 2025Jul07 RefID: D-94104C3"

FY 2026 BUDGET SUMMARY \n \nSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW \nThe United States faces one of the most \ndangerous strategic environments in our \nNation’s history. This environment is \ncharacterized by: \n• A U.S. Homeland vulnerable from years of \nunsecured borders and increasingly capable \nair and missile threats; \n• China’s unprecedented military buildup and \nthe direct threat that it poses to America’s \nsecurity and economy; and \n• A range of other threats, including Russia, Iran, North Korea, and select terrorist \norganizations. \nIn the face of these threats, President Trump has \ncharged the Department with supporting his \nAmerica First defense policy agenda and \nachieving his vision of peace through strength.   \nThe scale and urgency of the challenges we face \ndemand clear prioritization, strategic discipline, \nand fiscal responsibility, all of which are reflected \nin this budget. \n \n \nINTERIM NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGIC GUIDANCE \nThis budget is built around advancing the priorities of the Interim National Defense Strategic \nGuidance and the Secretary of Defense’s Message to the Force: \n• Reestablish deterrence against those who would threaten the American people by: \n Defending the Homeland, including by sealing our borders; repelling forms of invasion \nincluding illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking; advancing America’s interests in the \nWestern Hemisphere; modernizing and diversifying nuclear forces; bolstering cyber \ncapabilities; conducting resource -sustainable counter -terror operations focused on \norganizations that possess capability and willingness to strike the homeland; and, \ndefending the American people through President Trump’s Golden Dome next-generation \nmissile shield. \n \nSections \n• Strategic Overview \n• Interim National Defense Strategic \nGuidance \n• FY 2026 Budget Request Overview \n• Resource Alignment \n• Conclusion \n“The President gave us a clear mission: achieve Peace through Strength.  We \nwill do this in three ways — by restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our \nmilitary, and reestablishing deterrence.” \n- Secretary of Defense Peter B.

This includes funding the \nPresident’s priorities of shipbuilding, \nstrengthening our space capabilities, and \nthe development of the next generation \nfighter aircraft, the F-47. \n Empowering allies and partners to do more \nin recognition that we will put America’s \ninterests first, while ensuring the United \nStates can provide critical but more targeted support where required around the globe. \n• Rebuild the military and revitalize America’s defense industrial base by: \n Realizing savings through reform and optimization that can be applied directly towards \nincreased lethality.  In partnership with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), \nthe Department continues to assess its workforce requirements across the enterprise and \nimplement strategic reforms to our acquisition processes and business practices. \n Investing in our industrial base for critical requirements, such as munitions, ships, and \nsubmarines, in a manner consistent with President Trump’s intent to use the Department’s \nlimited resources responsibly. \n• Restore the warrior ethos by refocusing the Department on core warfighting missions, giving \na pay raise to our military personnel, and making investments to increase their quality of life. \nFY 2026 BUDGET REQUEST OVERVIEW \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) Fiscal Year (FY)  2026 budget request of $961. 6 billion \nrepresents a 13.4 percent increase over FY 2025 and del ivers on the President’s promise to \nachieve peace through strength by providing the resources to rebuild America’s military, \nreestablish deterrence, and restore the warrior ethos. \nFigure 1.1 DoD Budget \n$ in billions FY 2024 \nActuals \nFY 2025 \nEnacted \nFY 2026 \nRequest \nDiscretionary 842.3 848.3 848.3 \nMandatory 1 - - 113.3 \nSupplemental 2 67.3 11.8 - \nTotal 909.6 860.1 961.6 \nDiscretionary Budget Authority  Numbers may not add due to rounding \n1 In addition to discretionary resources, the Administration assumes at least $150 billion for defense will be enacted in a mandatory \nreconciliation bill later this fiscal year with approximately $113.3 billion spent in FY 2026 for DoD activities. \n2 FY 2024 includes supplemental funding for Ukraine ($48.4 billion), Israel ($13 billion), and Indo-Pacific/U.S. Submarine Industrial \nBase (SIB) ($5.9 billion).  FY 2025 includes supplemental funding for Virginia-class cost increases and SIB ($5.7 billion), National \nSecurity System risk reduction ($913 million), and Natural Disasters ($5.2 billion). \nAs Secretary Hegseth has highlighted to Congress, for FY 2026, “ we have two bills and one \nbudget.”  The $961.6 billion request is made up of an $848.3 billion discretionary budget request \nand $113.3 billion in mandatory funding from the reconciliation bill.  Passing both the discretionary \nbudget and the mandatory reconciliation bill is essential to properly resource our military."

The decade-long Budget Control Act (BCA), which lasted  \n Figure 1.2.  DoD Budget FY 2010 – FY 2026* \nthrough FY  2021, significantly reduced Defense budgets after the previous decade of build-up in \nboth the base and OCO funding related to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan following the events \nof 9/11.  Emerging from the BCA, the FY 2022 budget eliminated the separate OCO request, but \nfunds were retained for continued support of the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to \ndeter Iran and to provide for over -the-horizon operations for Afghanistan.  The FY  2024 base \nbudget aligned with funding levels agreed to in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and FY 2025 \nreflects the enactment of the first-ever full-year continuing resolution (CR) for the Department.\n \nThe FY 2026 budget realigns the military to the historic strength that began in President Trump’s \nfirst term and makes generational investments in the President’s priorities , including developing \nthe Golden Dome for America, sealing the Southern  Border, investing in the F- 47 fighter, \nrevitalizing our shipbuilding industry, and shaping end strength to match the threats we face. \nThese investments are amplified by the savings and efficiencies that the Department found during \nthe FY 2026 Budget Relook and in collaboration with the DOGE .  Shortly after his confirmation, \nSecretary Hegseth directed a budget relook to ensure the FY  2026 President’s Budget will \n“resource the fighting force we need, cease unnecessary spending, reject excessive bureaucracy, \nand drive actionable reform , including progress on the audit.”  Through this process, the \nDepartment identified and realigned nearly $30  billion in resources to high-priority programs , \nincreasing lethality and readiness by eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending,  targeting \nbureaucratic excess, and reducing redundant, low-impact programs."

REESTABLISH DETERRENCE \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Secretary of Defense has directed DoD to \nreestablish deterrence against those who would \nthreaten the American people by allocating \nresources towards: \n• Defending the homeland, including sealing \nour borders; repelling forms of invasion \nincluding illegal immigration and narcotics \ntrafficking; advancing America’s interests in \nthe Western Hemisphere; modifying and diversifying nuclear forces; bolstering cyber \ncapabilities; conducting counterterror operations focused on organizations that possess \ncapability and willingness to strike the homeland; and defending the American people through \nPresident Trump’s Golden Dome next-generation missile shield.   \n• Deterring China in the Indo- Pacific by prioritizing combat credible military forces and \ncapabilities postured forward in the Western Pacific .  This includes funding the President’s \nshipbuilding priorities, strengthening our space capabilities, and developing the next -\ngeneration fighter aircraft, the F-47. \n• We should empower our allies and partners to do more for their defense while ensuring the \nUnited States can provide critical but more targeted support where required around the globe. \nDEFENDING THE HOMELAND \nHomeland Border Security Initiatives \nOn January 20, 2025, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency at the \nSouthern Border of the United States (Proclamation 10886) . U nder Executive Order 14159 \n“Protecting the American People Against Invasion”, Executive Order 14165 “Securing Our \nBorders”, and Executive Order 14167 “Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial \nIntegrity of the United States”, he directed the United States to seal the U.S. southern border and \nmaintain the sovereign territorial integrity and security of the United States.  \nDoD’s homeland border security initiatives  aim to protect Americans’ safety and security while \npreserving the United States’ territorial sovereignty to defend  the homeland.  Defending the \nhomeland is one of DoD’s most fundamental and historic missions.  As such, DoD is working \nclosely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to secure the southern border through \na multi-pronged approach to both deter individuals from unlawfully entering the United States and \ndetaining and removing those who have unlawfully crossed into the United States.  \nTo achieve operational control of the border, DoD has deployed military personnel to the southern \nborder to work alongside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (ICE) .  Together, they  monitor and secure the border utilizing \nsurveillance and reconnaissance technology to support detections and CBP/ICE apprehension of \nindividuals unlawfully crossing the border.  National Defense Areas have been established to \nfurther DoD’s ability to implement the President’s mission to seal and secure the border.  \nThe DoD is also executing its mission to counter narcotics trafficking and transnational organized \ncrime by supporting DHS in temporarily holding individuals who have crossed illegally and have \na nexus to such illegal activities  at continental United States (CONUS) sites and Naval Station \nGuantanamo Bay.  These actions show real consequences , such as removing those remaining \nSections \n• Introduction \n• Defending the Homeland \n• Deterring China \n• Empowering Allies and Partners"

In addition, DoD is \nexecuting the construction of a permanent border barrier, authorized under DoD authorities,  \nalong the southern border, reinforcing physical deterrence.  Through these efforts, DoD remains \ncommitted to defending the homeland and supporting DHS in its evolving requirements to execute \nthe President’s orders and secure the border. \nGolden Dome \nPresident Trump signed Executive Order 14186 on January 27, 2025, calling for the development \nand fielding of a Golden Dome for America (GDA), a next -generation missile defense shield to \ndefend citizens and critical infrastructure against ballistic and hypersonic weapons, advanced \ncruise missiles, and other next -generation aerial attacks.  This effort will require a whole- of-\ngovernment approach, with leadership selected by and accountable directly to the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense. \nThe GDA architecture aims to build upon existing capabilities to provide a thorough layered \ndefense for the U.S. homeland and regional defenses.  It will incorporate advanced technologies, \nincluding space-based sensing, warning, and interceptors, and a seamless command and control \nto ensure complete interoperability with current and future capabilities.  \nThe FY 2026 President’s Budget will identify initiatives for the GDA program while advancing the \ndevelopment, testing, and fielding of reliable, increasingly capable, advanced missile defenses.  \nThese investments aim to strengthen the Nation’s ability to effectively address diverse threats \nwhile establishing a robust and resilient industrial supply chain. \nMissile Defeat and Defense \nThe Department will continue to develop an integrated missile defense built on flexibility and \nadaptability to address new threats, promote tighter interoperability, and dominance in space.  \nThe FY 2026 budget request supports prior requests to develop and field diversified missile defeat \nand defense (MDD) capabilities to counter the advancing threat. \nThe FY 2026 budget builds on previous enhancements to \nU.S. MDD capabilities to defend the homeland and \ndeployed forces/allies/partners against an increasingly \ncomplex adversary missile threat.  This budget request \nmaintains missile defense capacity and capability to keep \npace with advancing threats.  The FY 2026 budget request \nincludes $43.3 billion for MDD, including $13.1  billion for \nthe Missile Defense Agency (MDA), $15.2 billion in \nregional and strategic missile defense capabilities outside \nof MDA, and $14.9 billion for advanced technology missile \ndefeat efforts and other left-of-launch activities. \nIn FY 2026, the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program will continue developing, integrating, \nand testing a highly capable, survivable, and reliable strategic interceptor to protect the homeland \nagainst projected ballistic missile threats from all adversaries.    \n“I promised the American people that I would build a cutting-edge missile \ndefense shield to protect our homeland from the threat of foreign missile \nattack, and that's what we're doing today.” \n- President Donald J.

The decrease is primarily driven by reduced costs in the USCENTCOM \narea of responsibility as DoD continues to right -size its forward military presence per the 2025 \nInterim National Defense Strategic Guidance .  This budget request maintains our forces’  \nreadiness level  with operations, training, and maintenance funding.  The FY 2026 budget \nprioritizes exercises and campaigning for priority theaters to meet the pacing challenge and to \nstrengthen relationships. \nThese requirements also include funds for critical contingencies and other support for personnel \nin-theater, including support from units and forces outside Iraq and Syria.  Within this category \nare incremental costs such as surveillance systems capabilities; production and replacement of \npayloads, retrofits, and spare parts to support combat operations; counter-small unmanned aerial \nsystem platforms and launcher systems; medical equipment support; fire support, and other \ncapabilities located elsewhere that support operations in Iraq, Syria, and other important missions.  \nSupport for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities is also included.   \nThe FY 2026 request also funds the replacement of  equipment and munitions used in combat \noperations.  When military personnel return from deployments, they repair their equipment to a \ncondition that allows them to conduct training exercises to maintain readiness, preparing them for \nfuture deployments.  As personnel and equipment return from the theater to their home stations, \nthe need for equipment reset continues. \nAdditionally, the FY 2026 request includes $358  million for the \nCounter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) to strengthen the \ncapabilities of DoD’s counter -ISIS partner forces, including the \nprovision of secure and humane detention of ISIS fighters, to \nachieve the enduring defeat of ISIS.  The request inc ludes \n$130 million to assist the Vetted Syrian Groups and individuals \nin Syria , $ 213 million to assist security forces in Iraq , and  \n$15 million to support the Lebanese Armed Forces. \nThe FY 2026 budget request provides for continued military operations, force protection, and \ndeterrence in the USCENTCOM region related to current operations in support of Israel, including \noperations to protect shipping in the Red Sea from attacks by Iran -backed Houthi forces.  The \nDepartment will continue supporting Israel’s defense through security assistance, deterring any \nmalign actors in the region, and staying vigilant to any threats to U.S. forces. \nDoD Support to NATO  \nThe FY 2026 budget request includes $656.7 million within the Operation and Maintenance, Army \naccount for NATO common funding requirements associated with the NATO military budget.

Competitors and non- state actors in the \nhomeland and abroad continue to seek advantage through coercive and malign activities in the \n“gray zone,” below a threshold they perceive as likely to prompt a U.S. military response.   Our \nactions today will determine the security environment of the future.   SOF provides a decisive \nadvantage for the nation.  \nThe FY  2026 budget increases SOF lethality through modernizing approaches, tactics, and \ntechnologies.  It continues to invest in new technologies that support SOF -unique requirements, \nwhich include data- driven technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and \nalgorithm development.   The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) continues to \nprogress across multiple programs, including the ongoing modernization of AC/ MC -130J and \nrotary wing aircraft platforms, and the procurement of Multi-mission Electronic Countermeasures \nand other Electronic Warfare Family of Systems equipment designed to counter and protect \nagainst evolving threat matrices and better understand the electromagnetic environment to \nsupport maneuver, situational awareness, and force protection mission \nrequirements.  Investments also include a continuing effort to advance the development and \nprocurement of autonomous weapons systems and the means to counter similar threats of our \nadversaries in a multi-domain battlespace environment.  Accordingly, the USSOCOM is building \non its Adaptive Airborne Enterprise, designed to enable multi -platform control and management \nof multiple Unmanned Aerial Systems and payloads, as well as improving the interoperability of \nadvanced air, ground, and maritime systems within a mesh- networked Command and Control \necosystem. \nMunitions \nTo support the INDSG, the Department continues \nfocusing on innovation and modernization.  To \naddress the persistent threats worldwide, the \nDepartment is focused on  addressing emerging \nthreats and ensuring readiness for future conflicts.  \nThis strategy shift focuses on enhancing lethality and \nintegrating advanced technologies .  Major initiatives \nare underway to deliver munitions with greater \npenetration power.  In addition, the Department is  \nrapidly advancing a range of munitions capabilities to \naddress evolving battlefield threats, ensure tactical \novermatch in future conflicts, and increase production capacity.  The Department is also investing \nin maintaining short-range munitions to ensure proper readiness levels that offer an array of \neffects in permissive theaters.  The FY  2026 budget ensures the Department is prepared to \nrespond in a dynamic threat landscape, which is paramount.   \nMany munitions are precision- guided, enhancing the attack of a broader target set, with limited \nlow-collateral damage employed by more than one Service and U.S. allies.  This family of weapon \nsystems includes land-attack missiles such as the Precision Stri ke Missile (PrSM), Joint Air -to-\nSurface Standoff Missile (JASSM), and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) upgrades.   \nThe Department has invested in Counter- Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS) and Unmanned \nAerial Systems (UAS).  It delivers cost -effective, laser-guided precision, offering warfighters a \nscalable solution against soft and light armored targets.  As the operational environment grows, \nincreasingly dynamic and drone- enabled threats proliferate, the DoD is prioritizing the rapid \ndevelopment and fielding of CUAS and UAS to protect forces and enhance battlefield agility."

CUAS and UAS represent the cutting edge of the Department’s \nlayered approach to air defense and tactical ISR, delivering responsive, scalable capabilities \ntailored to joint and multi-domain operations. \nAchieving overmatch in our anti -ship capabilities with rigorously pursued development is the \nStandard Missile (SM -6), Long -Range Anti -Ship Missile (LRASM), and the Maritime Strike \nTomahawks (MST), which will help to neutralize the enemy’s anti -access/area denial (A2/AD) \ncapabilities, ships, and air defenses.  The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) delivers long- range, \nhigh-speed, precision strikes against high- value targets in contested environments.  Guided \nMultiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is a family of  surface-to-surface artillery rockets with \nprecision strike capability.   \nInconsistent year-over-year demand for new production limits our suppliers’ ability to ramp up \nproduction rates to meet emergent military requirements quickly.  Additionally, to meet the needs \nof sustained, high- intensity conflict and bolster warfighting capabilities, the Department is \nprioritizing investments that accelerate munitions production and expand the resilience of the \ndefense industrial base.  This includes targeted funding for production line modernization, \nadvanced manufacturing technologies, and procuring long- lead materials to reduce delivery \ntimelines.  This enables our Organic Industrial Base (OIB) and industry to scale faster and more \nconfidently.   \nThe Department has undertaken significant initiatives to enhance the OIB and collaborate with \nthe commercial sector to expand munitions production capabilities for: \n• Naval Strike Missile (NSM) (Navy, USMC) \n• Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) (Navy, Army) \n• Precision Strike Munition (PrSM) (Army) \n• Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) (Air Force, Navy) \n• Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) (Navy, Air Force) \n• Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) (Air Force) \n• Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) (Army) \n• Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) (Army) \n• 155mm Artillery (Army) \nThe FY 2026 Defense Budget allocates $30.5 billion for munitions development and procurement, \nunderscoring a strategic pivot toward modern, high- performance capabilities.  This includes \nfunding for key munitions as well as $94. 9 million for 20,841 XM1128 rounds, $84. 4 million for \n8,250 XM1113 rounds, and $39.5 million for 2,278 C-DAEM Increment II rounds—all designed to \nenhance precision, range, and battlefield adaptability.  The budget also sustains funding for the \nM1121 Extended Range Spotting Round to maintain war reserve readiness. \nAligned with this modernization effort, funding for several legacy munitions, such as the \nM485/M1124, M1066/M1123, M1210 HE -RAP, M107, and M795, has been eliminated for  \nFY 2026.  This reflects a multifaceted decision based on the sufficiency of existing stockpiles and \na deliberate shift in strategic priorities.  By reallocating resources away from systems with \ndiminishing relevance, the Department reinforces its commitment to investing in munitions that \noffer greater lethality, range, and adaptability for future combat environments.  Recurring threats \nin an ever-changing battlefield are across multiple domains and require a multi-prong approach."

Today’s DIB requires additional investment from private \nand government sources to modernize infrastructure and capacity to provide military capabilities \nat the speed and scale necessary for the U.S. to prevail in a near-peer conflict.  The Department \nmust focus on investment, buying down supply chain risk, and expanding capacity to adapt and \nfortify our existing capabilities and capacities.  This will require investment in the systems, \nprocesses, and workforce used to produce military capabilities and the infrastructure. \nDefense production and services are part of a vast, diverse, and global ecosystem that draws \nfrom technology and manufacturing sectors, foreign and domestic.  The National Defense \nIndustrial Strategy (NDIS) describes the Department’s strategic approach to developing a modern \nDIB.  The NDIS framework outlines four priorities for achieving a 21st-century DIB:  \n \n• Resilient Supply Chains  \n• Workforce Readiness  \n• Flexible Acquisition   \n• Economic Deterrence  \nThe strategy recognizes that the Department cannot institute these changes alone.  Great effort, \ncooperation, and coordination among the federal U.S. government, private industry, and our \ninternational allies and partners will be needed to modernize sectors and services that support \nthe warfighters.  Aligning ongoing efforts within the NDIS priorities will enable better coordination \namong programs, allowing quicker identification of strategic opportunities and challenges and \npotential responses such as investment or policy modification. \nCross-governmental efforts will be necessary to create the legal and policy conditions that allow \nnew entrants into the defense production and services community to add resilience to the \nDIB.  The Department must solicit entrants of all types:  large and s mall, domestic and foreign, \nand those with no previous relationship to DoD or defense production, while developing new \npublic-private dialogues and relationships. \nDefense Industrial Base \nThe DIB, comprised of the commercial and \norganic industrial base, ensures the United States \nhas the industrial capability and capacity to \nprovide goods and services to meet current and \nfuture Defense requirements.  This includes \nsupporting research and development, design, \nproduction, deployment, and sustainment of \nDefense platforms and weapons systems and \ntheir enabling technology areas.  While the \nexisting DIB structure is sufficient for predictable \ndefense materiel production and consumption \nrates for peacetime training and operations, the \nDIB exists to ensure it can ramp appropriately to meet wartime needs.  As DIB strategy and the \nNDIS efforts and activities evolve, this ramping and production capacity will be an increasing \nfocus.  \nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Department has committed more than \n$63.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including support for air defense, long-range fires,"

This \nincrease includes funding for a 3.8 percent military pay raise, which builds on the 4.5 percent \nbasic pay increase in January 2025 and the additional 10 percent basic pay increase for junior \nenlisted members implemented in April 2025 and is critical to retention efforts.   \nThe FY 2026 Total Force end strength increases by 24,700 from the FY 2025 authorized level \nand will increase by 14,932 from the currently projected FY 2025 levels.  This increase accounts \nfor the record-breaking recruiting encountered under the Trump Administration.  The \nDepartment’s force structure investments support the Interim National Defense Strategic \nGuidance to size and shape the Joint Force under an America First agenda to restore peace \nthrough strength. \nFinancial Strength for Warfighters \nEconomic security of Service members and military families is critical to mission readiness.  \nMilitary compensation must remain competitive with the private sector, and the FY 2026 budget \nrequest addresses both the high stress and demands being placed on the force, the current labor \nmarket, and inflationary pressures.  Actions taken across the Department include,  but are not \nlimited to, increased basic allowances for housing and subsistence; adjustments to the basic \nneeds allowance program; increased access to healthy food on installations and throughout the \ncommissary system; and improved availability of financial readiness resources. \nThe Department is also reviewing overseas tour lengths and extending prescribed ones, where \nfeasible.  In addition, we implemented the Basic Needs Allowance and recently increased the \neligibility and payment threshold from 150 to 200 percent of the Federal  Poverty Guidelines, \nensuring that more junior members with large families will receive the financial resources that they \nneed and do not have to rely upon Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.  With the \n“No one serves alone, it's you, your kids, your spouses, your communities, \nyour churches, the people that love you, the people that support you that \nbelieve in what we do. We have your back.”  \n        - Secretary of Defense Peter B. Hegseth, Special Operations Forces Week, May 2025"

Department support in this area includes financial assessments and \ncounseling; improved access to and increased assistance with child care; education subsidies \nand employment support for spouses; and increased access to nutritious and affordable food \noptions.  These efforts are designed to reduce stigma, normalize financial help-seeking behaviors, \nand improve stability for warfighters and families.  The Department has expanded the resources \navailable through our Economic Security Toolkit on Military OneSource and is now including a \nmore robust selection of resources on nutrition readiness, food security, and food access. \nThe Department also works across the federal government to foster interagency collaboration to \nbetter understand food security data and to build evidence to strengthen food security and \nnutrition readiness across the force.   We have extended our formal partnership with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) to further explore how methodological differences between the \nDepartment’s Status of Forces Survey of Active-Duty Members (SOFS-A) and the U.S. Census \nBureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS), the data source for Economic Research Service’s \nannual household food security report, may impact the comparability of military food security rates \nto USDA’s national estimates.  The Department has also extended data collection for a separate \nqualitative study examining food access on and near outside the continental United States \n(OCONUS) military installations.  The actions taken to date are not all inclusive.  As we continue \nto increase our knowledge of the underlying issues that undermine the economic security  of the \nforce, we will modify our response accordingly.  \nManaging the Military Health System \nThe Military Health System (MHS) is one of America’s largest and most complex health care \ninstitutions, and the world’s preeminent military health care delivery operation. The MHS saves \nlives on the battlefield, combats infectious diseases globally, and provides health services to \napproximately 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed Service members, military retirees, \nand family members.  The MHS leverages its facilities and relies on the private sector for \nadditional capacity to accomplish its complex and multifaceted mission, ensuring a force that is \nmedically ready for combat, resilient to obstacles and attack, and prepared to defend the nation.  \nPerforming much more than combat medicine, the MHS engages in health care delivery, medical \neducation, public health, private sector partnerships, and cutting- edge medical research and \ndevelopment. \nThe MHS readiness mission spans a broad portfolio of operational requirements, including \ncombat casualty care, disaster relief, global health engagement, and humanitarian assistance.  \nKey enablers of the system include the DoD medical school – the Uniformed Services University \nof the Health Sciences – plus a full spectrum of graduate medical education programs, robust \nresearch capabilities, and customized training platforms ensuring that all Active and Reserve \nmedical personnel are ready to provide medical care for operational forces worldwide. \n \nThe Fiscal Year 2026 budget request for military medicine is $65.9 billion – a 7.4 percent \nincrease from the Fiscal Year 2025 enacted position.  The $65.9 billion is the Unified \nMedical Budget amount which includes the Defense Health Program appropriation \nrequest, Military Personnel costs, Military Construction costs, and Health Care Accrual \ncontributions from the Services to the Medicare Healthcare accrual fund."

It provides the direction, resources, health care \npersonnel, and other means to promote and improve the health of our warfighters, their families, \nand those who served and retired.  The MHS develops and promotes health awareness issues to \neducate beneficiaries, discover and resolve environmentally based health threats, and provide \ncomprehensive health care services. This includes  preventive care and intervention services, \nperforming comprehensive health surveillance, and improv ing the means and methods for \nmaintaining the health of the beneficiary population by constantly evaluating the performance of \nhealth support.  The funding and personnel to support the MHS mission are grouped under the \nUnified Medical Budget (UMB).

The \ndifference between FY 2025 and FY 2026 within the DHP is driven predominant ly by the \ninvestment in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) to sustain direct care capabilities, as well \nas investments in modernizing electronic health records/digital health.  Within the FY 2026 DHP \nrequest, $21.0 billion, or 51 percent of the total request, is for private sector care supporting the \nprovision of the TRICARE benefit to the DoD beneficiary population.  Finally, the health care \naccruals funding increase in FY 2026 is due to actuarial updates for actual claims experiences \nand updates to other actuarial assumptions, as approved by the DoD Board of Actuaries.  \nThe MHS continues to pursue efforts focused on business process improvements, structural \nchanges, and efficiencies within the MTFs.  It is modernizing clinical and business processes and \nstreamlining internal operations to support health care delivery in the direct care system. \nContinued Transformation of the MHS \nThe Department recognizes a strategic imperative to rebuild our \nmilitary and civilian medical workforce and to more effectively \nresource the MHS.  One of the most effective ways to accomplish \nthe goal of transforming the MHS in support of the mission is to  \nreattract beneficiaries to MTFs and to maximize medical education \nand training pipelines.   \nAttracting beneficiaries to MTFs and Dental Treatment Facilities requires a stable, predictable \nworkforce that is sufficiently staffed, trained, and routinely available to provide health care \nFigure 4.1.

Rebuilding medical capabilities and providing increased support to our clinical \npersonnel is critical, but it will take time and focused effort to accomplish, while continuing to \nensure necessary operational medical support.  \nThe FY 2026 budget request provides key resources for the MHS, focused on improving patient \naccess to services, in part, by better integrating the direct and purchased care systems and \nfostering continuous improvement.  Resources will be aligned to support warfighter lethality. \nStabilizing, modernizing, and integrating MHS capabilities will help the MHS to successfully  \nsupport Service members who are fit to fight and medical professionals who are ready to support \nthem in garrison training and on the battlefield. \nMHS Information Management and Information Technology \nThe Defense Health Agency (DHA) is building a modernized, integrated, and resilient Health \nDelivery System, focusing on Digitizing healthcare for the MHS.  The Information Management / \nInformation Technology (IM/IT) portfolio within the DHP provides the transformational technology \nenablers critical to DHA’s modernization goals for the MHS.  The  \nFY 2026 budget request includes $0.3 billion to support the continued modernization efforts of \nthe MHS, addressing the MHS Enterprise's aging infrastructure and deg raded MTF operational \nIT support, and mounting technical debt. \nDigital Health Strategy  \nAs MHS looks ahead to a new strategic and technological environment, it must aggressively \nharness new and emerging digital health technologies.  The surge in digital health care across \nthe U.S. and with our allies and partners in recent years has  provided valuable lessons on the \naccessibility of digital health, particularly its impact on health outcomes, equity, and costs.   \nDigital health transformation represents paradigm -shifting opportunities for MHS to reimagine \nhealth care.  However, simply layering digital technologies on top of the current model will not \nlead to large -scale improvement.  Successfully implementing a digital health transformation \nrequires the MHS to fundamentally rethink health care delivery in day -to-day, operational, and \ncombat settings.  The FY 2026 budget request lays the groundwork for the digital transformation \nstrategy informed by industry-leading practices, requirements, and input from the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Military Departments, and DHA. \nStrengthening Military Families  \nMilitary families ensure that our warfighters remain focused on and ready to meet the mission.  \nThe Department delivers military family assistance through a robust Military Family Readiness \nSystem that includes child care; youth development and school liai sons; support for family \nmembers with special needs; relocation assistance; non -medical counseling; Morale, Welfare, \nand Recreation (MWR); spouse employment; and military family support programs. \nThe major initiatives to improve quality of life for Service members and their families are strategic \ninvestments in the military’s most valuable asset, its people.  They reflect the Department’s \ncommitment to improving Service member wellness and delivering prevention and response \nefforts targeting factors that contribute to readiness-detracting behaviors.   \nThe Department continues to promote and support spouse employment initiatives, including the \nMilitary Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP) and military spouse preference for relocating \nspouses of Active- Duty members.

The Military Spouse Career \nAccelerator Pilot (MSCAP) sponsors eligible spouses in 12-week, paid fellowships across \nthe corporate landscape.   More than 1,000 military spouses have participated in the \nprogram, with more than 80 percent receiving employment offers from their host \nemployers.  The Military Spouse Employment Partnership added more than 230 employer \npartners, growing the partnership to more than 950 active employers.  Since the launch of \nMSEP in 201 1, partner employers have reported placing more than 360,000 military -\nconnected spouses across all industry sectors.  Finally, the My Career Advancement \nAccount (MyCAA), which awards up to $4,000 to eligible spouses toward a license, \ncredential, associate’s degree, or required vocational testing or evaluations, expanded \neligibility to include spouses of all Active-Duty enlisted pay grades, as well as those of O1s \nto O3s and W1s to W3s.  Last year, MyCAA supported the education and training pursuits \nof more than 9,400 military spouses.  \nDoD continues to work with state policy and lawmakers to enact occupational licensure compacts, \nwhich are state laws that provide consistent rules for licensed practitioners to work in other states \nand territories.   Thirty-four states have adopted six or more compacts.   All military spouses, \nincluding National Guard and Reserve spouses, Active- Duty Service members, members of the \nGuard and Reserve, and veterans, benefit from the mobility provided by compacts, which \nminimize the time and expense required to secure employment upon relocation to a new state.  \nFor military families, this helps to ensure continuity of military spouse employment, enhancing the \nfinancial readiness and wellness of military families. \nThe Domestic Employees Teleworking Overseas (DETO) Memorandum of Agreement permits \nfederal employees, including military spouses, to perform the duties and responsibilities of their \npositions in an approved overseas location via a DETO agreement, approved by the Department \nof State.  This affords military spouses the opportunity to continue working for a federal agency \nwhen Service members receive OCONUS orders.  \nMilitary OneSource, a 24/7 information and assistance contact center, links military members and \ntheir families to resources and support and preemptively provides non -medical counseling to \naddress stressful situations.

The FY 2026 \nbudget request demonstrates this commitment to \nJoint Force readiness by balancing immediate \ninvestments in capabilities with mid - and long-\nterm modernization requirements aligned with \nInterim National Defense Strategic Guidance.   \nThe nation needs warfighters who are prepared to deter our enemies, defend the homeland, and \nmaintain the most effective fighting force in the world.  In turn, DoD requires data-driven insights \ninto the inevitable readiness tradeoffs tomorrow resulting from decisions made today.  The \nStrategic Readiness Framework offers Department leaders visibility into this complex risk picture \nacross various dimensions and time horizons.  Strategic Readiness is realized through the \ncontinuous development of tools, assessments, and data models  that improve decision \nadvantage and inform readiness investment across all aspects of operational and tactical \nexcellence, to include personnel, equipment, training, leadership, and safety.   \nThe Secretary of Defense issues guidance for budget planning and programming purposes to \nensure that the Department invests in readiness capabilities matching and exceeding current and \nfuture threats.  Through the FY 2026 budget, the Department will strengthen deterrence and gain \nadvantage, in part, by developing our warriors and cultivating advanced systems and capabilities.   \nThis will enable DoD to synchronize the Joint Force with other instruments of national power to \ncounter forms of competitor coercion, complicate the military preparations of our competitors, and \ncontinue advancing warfighting capabilities together with our allies and partners.  It is modernizing \nweapon systems, training, workforce processes, and doctrines to meet future Joint Force design \nneeds, focused on innovation and agility to address evolving demands.

The Marine Corps ' annual \nservice-level training exercises provide important opportunities to conduct missions in different \nenvironments, generating combat readiness for all Fleet Marine Force participants.   \nThe Marine Corps invests $0.8 billion in FY  2026 in support of its Service- Level Training \nInstallations to ensure Marines are properly trained to address all warfighting functions across the \nrange of military operations.  The premier Service- Level Training Exercises within the Marine \nCorps are the Integrated Training Exercise (ITX), Adversary Force Exercise (AFX), Marine Air \nGround Task Force Warfighting Exercise (MWX), and Mountain Exercise (MTX).  The ITX and \nAFX are separate live-fire events that collectively culminate in an MWX, a non-live fire event. The \nITX units compete against AFX units as a free- thinking peer adversary in a multi -domain \nenvironment.  These three events (ITX, AFX, and MWX) occur at the Marine Corps Air Ground \nCombat Center at Twentynine Palms, California.  The MTX, conducted at the Marine Corps \nMountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, California, prepares units for combat in high-\naltitude, cold weather, and mountainous operations.  The MTX units also conduct live-fire training \nat the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center upon completing training at Bridgeport.  The \nService-Level Training Exercises prepare all elements of the Marine Corps Air-Ground Task \nForce (MAGTF), active and reserve, across the warfighting functions, for worldwide deployment \nto conduct combat operations.

Rapid technological advancement and threat evolution continue to challenge training \nmodernization, widening the gap between how the Joint Force trains and how it operates in an \nall-domain fight.  To maintain a decisive military advantage over peer adversaries in multi-domain \noperations, the DoD is changing its approach to developing training capabilities by elevating \ntraining investments, reforming business practices, and prioritizing commonality and \ninteroperability.  The framework for this change is the Secretary’s Joint Operational Training \nInfrastructure Strategy.  Selected training initiatives in the FY 2026 President’s Budget include: \n• Joint Simulation Environment (JSE) and Joint Integrated Training Centers (JITCs) \nGiven its high-fidelity capability, the JSE is expanding beyond its original use for F -35 \nsynthetic environment testing to an all -domain pacing threat readiness environment for \nthe Joint Force.  The JITC will be a government -owned center operating the JSE, \nmitigating the air combat training lag challenge and filling fidelity gaps by co- locating \nsimulator bays of tier -one assets (F-35, F-22, Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), \nEA-18G, B -21, E -7, E -2D, AEGIS, Patriot, THAAD, HIMARS, Space, and Cyber) in a \nsingle facility.  Full operational capacity and fielding of the JITC will offer a path for tier-\none operators to train in an all- domain pacing threat scenario that is not offered by any \nother technology.  From a workforce management perspective, all Joint Force trainees are \nco-located during the training event, creating a learning environment that does not exist \nacross a distributed exercise. JITCs are planned in USINDOPACOM and USEUCOM and \nare supplemented by F-35 home station, low-fidelity JSE enclaves for Title 10 training. \n• Pacific Multi -Domain Training and Experimentation Capability (PMTEC) and \nEuropean Multi-Domain Training and Experimentation Capability (EMTEC) \nThe USINDOPACOM’s PMTEC will provide the ability to train the Joint Force, allies, and \npartners via linkages between ranges.  The PMTEC will form the world’s largest, fully \ninstrumented coalition range system with the most advanced capabilities for virtualization, \nsimulation, and operational rehearsal over long distances via integrated joint live, virtual, \nand constructive (JLVC) training.  The PMTEC’s initial success has spurred the creation \nof EMTEC to leverage these successful efforts in the European theater. \n  \nFigure 4.8.

This is one of the core \nsolutions to producing the expert operators and advisors for efforts such as the Combined \nJoint All- Domain Command and Control initiative.  This course will leverage existing \nschoolhouse structures across DoD and produce graduates who will provide operational \nand planning insight for the Military Services, Joint Staff, and Combatant Commands.  The \ncourse is working on achieving course accreditation.   \n• Joint Modular Emitter Interphase Standards (JMEIS) \nThe JMEIS will leverage ongoing test and training threat emulator efforts to produce a joint \nstandard for industry to build to and for the Department to acquire in order to fill the gap in \nelectromagnetic spectrum systems for warfighter training purposes.  These standards \ninclude the integration of major emitter components, data and electronic file requirements, \nand range infrastructure controls.  The JMEIS effort will fill the training gap created by a \nreliance on limited, exquisite test -fidelity emitters and extremely low- cost, low-capability \nemitters. \n• Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Blue Team \nThe OSD Blue Team will place warfighting subject matter experts across the Department \nto assess the relevancy and realism of joint training and provide recommendations to close \npacing threat readiness gaps.  The OSD Blue Team will be the Department’s dedic ated \nteam to ensure joint and coalition operational warfighting is set against credible key \noperational problems.   \n• Defense Training Capability Assessments (DTCA) \nThe FY 2026 budget request institutionalizes an annual and repeatable assessment \nprocess designed to identify policy, programmatic, or budgetary actions that close pacing \nthreat training capabilities. The Department will provide the manpower augmented with  \nsoftware tools to capture insights from the OSD Blue Team, Service Centers of Excellence, \nand training installation cadres to identify and monitor gaps between training capabilities \nand all -domain, joint warfighting requirements.  Insights from DTCA will enable future \nplanning and budgeting to better ensure that joint training capabilities keep pace with real-\nworld threats and conditions. \n• Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) \nThe PCTE will be the Department’s primary cyberspace operations training and \ncertification source.  By the end of Phase II, the PCTE will support end-to-end (individual-\nto-collective) training for the full range of cyberspace forces, both Cyberspace Operations \nForces (COF) and non- COF.  The PCTE platform provides a competitive edge over our \nadversaries and offers the ability to deliver those same advantages to allies and partners.  \nExpanded access to the PCTE allows Combatant Commands to meet Theater Securi ty \nCooperation goals and facilitates National Guard cooperation with State Partnership \nProgram nations. \nJoint Training, Exercise, and Evaluation Program (JTEEP)  \nThe JTEEP is the Department’s primary means to prepare U.S. forces for globally integrated joint \nand combined operations across the competition continuum.  It provides resources to Combatant \nCommands and Military Departments to enable individual and collective training of U.S. forces to \nimprove joint readiness, prepare for high -end joint warfighting, and support day -to-day"

The program requests $901.8 million for FY 2026 to support these basic \nendeavors.  \nThe JTEEP has been rapidly updated to ensure activity alignment with the most recent Secretary \nof Defense guidance and Department priorities.  Senior leaders are actively looking for additional \nopportunities to capitalize on the dynamic capabilities joint exercises offer to realize improvements \nat the speed of relevance.   \nThe Combatant Commands use JTEEP funding for warfighting preparedness and day -to-day \ncompetition.  Annual funding for JTEEP enables the execution of more than 100 major Combatant \nCommand exercises aligned to support strategic guidance.  The JTEEP prepares U.S. forces to \nexecute operational plans, train Combatant Command staff in demanding and realistic \nenvironments, defend the homeland, and deter adversaries, while supporting and enabling key \nregional allies, and projecting peace through strength.   The JTEEP also includes Exercise -\nRelated Construction (ERC) funding to build exercise-related infrastructure needed by U.S. forces \nparticipating in joint exercises. Some notable functions and elements of the JTEEP enterprise are \nhighlighted below.  \n• U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) :  JUDICIOUS RESPONSE is the Command’s \npremier exercise, and how the Combatant Commander links the Joint Exercises Program \nto the Joint Warfighting Concept.  On alternating years, JUDICIOUS RESPONSE certifies \nUSAFRICOM’s ability to serve as the Joint Forces Command, and U.S. Army Europe and \nAfrica’s ability to serve as a Joint Task Force.  JUDICIOUS RESPONSE also integrates \nUSAFRICOM with globally integrated operations, including the Globally Integrated War \nGame, Globally Integrated Exercises, and Globally Integrated Campaign of Learning.  \nUSAFRICOM, in its support of the Joint Warfighting Concept, will seek to create dilemmas \nfor U.S. adversaries, prevent strategic distraction, and facilitate access, basing, and \noverflight across Africa.  In addition, USAFRICOM is synchronizing multiple regional \nJTEEP events to operationalize the Command’s East and West Africa approaches and \nemphasizes all-domain competencies.  In the west, USAFRICOM is aligning AFRICAN \nLION’s all- domain activities, OBANGAME EXPRESS’ s maritime activities, and \nFLINTLOCK’s special operations countering violent extremist organizations (CVEO) \nactivities.  In the east, USAFRICOM is aligning JUSTIFIED ACCORD’s land -force \nactivities with CUTLASS EXPRESS’ maritime activities.

REFORM & OPTIMIZATION \nOne of the key tenets of this Administration is \nthat reform and optimization efforts will guide, \nprioritize, and maximize efficiency in security, \nwhat we need now and in the future.  To this end, \nshortly after his confirmation, Secretary Hegseth \ndirected a relook of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 \nbudget to ensure it “will resource the fighting \nforce we need, cease unnecessary spending, \nreject excessive bureaucracy, and drive \nactionable reform, including progress on the \naudit.”   \nThe results of this process are reflected \nthroughout the FY  2026 President’s Budget \nrequest in the realignment of resources from \nwasteful and unnecessary priorities , such as \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and climate \nchange programs, to high-priority programs increasing lethality and readiness.  This budget seeks \nto ensure every single dollar of taxpayer money funds lethal Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airman, \nand Guardians and provides the capabilities to deter our adversaries, and if necessary, prevail on \nthe battlefield. \nTHE DOD CONSOLIDATED AUDIT STRATEGY \nThe annual financial statement audits are critical to the Department’s efforts to rebuild the military \nand revitalize America’s defense industry rapidly and at a reasonable cost.  Achieving an \nunmodified audit opinion will restore public trust and ensure that precious resources are used \nefficiently and effectively in support of the warfighter.  The Department is committed to achieving \nan unmodified audit opinion by December 31, 2028, as required by law.  \nThe financial statement audits are a priority for the Secretary of Defense, and achieving an \nunmodified audit opinion requires immediate and decisive action from all levels of the Department \nof Defense (DoD).  Department leaders must act with urgency to accomplish the following: \n• Accountability:  Prioritize rigorous tracking of all assets and funds to help eliminate waste and \nensure resources reach our warfighters.  \n• System Compliance and Improvement:  Replace outdated financial, logistics, and contract \nsystems with modern/auditable systems, focusing on Enterprise Resource Planning systems. \n• Financial Oversight and Operational Controls:  Leverage artificial intelligence and automation \nto accelerate predictive inventory, fraud detection, and enhanced cybersecurity, including \nSections \n• Department of Defense (DoD) \nConsolidated Audit Strategy  \n• DoD Strategic Management Plan \n• Defense Performance Improvement \nFramework \n• Ship/Aircraft Retirements/Optimization \nInitiatives \n• FY 2026 Relook Efficiencies & \nReductions \n• Department of Government Efficiency \n(DOGE) Identified Savings \n• PPBE Reform \n“The Department of Defense must pass a financial audit by 2028.  We will \nensure full accountability to Congress and the American taxpayer.  We will \nimprove our processes and controls to make better financial decisions.  And \nwe will understand where every taxpayer dollar goes and why.  This is what it \nwill take to rebuild our military and exactly what we will do.” \n- Secretary of Defense Peter B.

The audit comprised 28 standalone audits conducted by independent public \naccountants and the DoD Office of Inspector General.  Twelve reporting entities received an \nunmodified audit opinion, including the U.S. Marines Corps, which became the first DoD Military \nService to achieve an unmodified audit opinion in FY 2023, and which successfully sustained that \nopinion in FY 2024.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Logistics \nAgency’s (DLA) National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund (NDSTF) achieved their first \nunmodified audit opinions in FY 2024.  One reporting entity received a qualified audit opinion; all \nother reporting entities under a standalone audit and the DoD consolidated audit each resulted in \na disclaimer of opinion.  A disclaimer of opinion means the auditor could not obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence on which to base an opinion on the financial statements.  A disclaimer \nof opinion does not indicate, nor is it evidence or proof of, mismanagement.  For example, due to \nthe Department’s complex and decentralized Information Technology (IT) systems, the reporting \nentities are often unable to produce adequate supporting documentation to an auditor promptly , \nresulting in failed audit tests.    \nReporting entities collectively closed 8 material weaknesses and downgraded 13.  Notably,  \n9 reporting entities closed or downgraded their Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) material \nweakness in FY 2024.  FBWT represents the amount of funds the Department has available at \nthe Department of the Treasury; resolving this material weakness is foundational to achieving a \nDepartment-wide unmodified audit opinion.  This significant progress means that $707 billion of \nthe DoD-wide FY 2024 FBWT balance of $856 billion is free of material weaknesses.  Overall, \nthe Department has increased the number of closed and downgraded agency -wide material \nweaknesses from 7 in FY 2021 to 21 in FY 2024.  Additionally, the Department closed its DoD -\nwide Contingent Legal Liabilities material weakness, and Leases was added as a new DoD-wide \nmaterial weakness for FY 2024 – a net zero change in DoD-wide material weaknesses.   \nAudit Remediation  \nThe results of the annual financial statement audits provide insights into where the Department \nneeds to make operational improvements and how to prioritize those improvements.  In FY 2025, \nthe Department prioritized remediating audit findings in the following areas:  \n• Improve Fund Balance with the Treasury \n• Strengthen the Systems Control Environment \n• Advance the Universe of Transactions  \n• Optimize Asset Valuations \n• Integrate Procure to Pay Processes to Accelerate Auditability \nTo guide the process of addressing these priority areas, senior leaders across the Department \nuse audit roadmaps, the governance process, and working groups to foster accountability toward \nfinding solutions to common barriers for each reporting entity under a standalone audit receiving \na disclaimer of opinion.  The Military Departments and each reporting entity under a standalone \naudit with a disclaimer of opinion will continue to maintain an audit roadmap.  These audit \nroadmaps align audit remediation strategies across the Department and facilitate how each \nreporting entity directs its audit resources.  The roadmaps guide the implementation of corrective \nmeasures and establish milestones against which progress can be measured and the return on \nthe Department’s audit investment can be assessed."

By \nstreamlining congressional oversight, reducing fiscal inefficiencies, and accelerating \nmodernization investments, these reforms ensure more effective defense resource execution and \nwill facilitate delivering to the American warfighter the capabilities needed to remain the strongest \nand most lethal fighting force in the world. \nWe look forward to working with all stakeholders and Congress to enact these changes and build \na fiscally agile, operationally responsive defense resourcing enterprise poised to achieve peace \nthrough strength while restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and reestablishing \ndeterrence.   \nPPBE Reform and Other Budget Execution Flexibilities \nOperation and Maintenance (O&M) Funding:   This proposed appropriations language \nchanges the period of availability for five percent of the O&M funding from one to two years \nin the O&M appropriations.  This change reinforces good fiscal stewardship by giving \nfinancial managers a tool to make better year -end spending decisions and enables the \nDepartment to respond to emergent requirements and maximize the use of appropriated \nfunds for their intended purpose. \nTwo-Year Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Funding:   This proposed appropriations \nlanguage changes the period of availability for PCS funding from one to two years in the \nmilitary personnel appropriations for the Active Components.  This change maximizes the \nutilization of PCS funds, which typically cross fiscal years because of the seasonal nature \nof PCS moves, and minimizes the unexpended balances in the military personnel \nappropriations for the Active Components – ultimately allowing the DoD to maximize the \nuse of appropriated funds for their intended purpose.        \nIncreases to Below Threshold Reprogramming Limits:   This proposed appropriations \nreport language requests an increase to the reprogramming thresholds for some \nappropriations titles to amounts more consistent with historical percentages of inflation \nand the increases in the DoD budget.  Examples include $30 million for O&M; $25 million \nfor RDT&E; and $40 million for Procurement funding.  This increase is needed to minimize \ndelays in the execution of funds and provide greater flexibility to address unanticipated \nrequirements in the year of execution.   \nArmy Agile Funding Pilot Program:   This proposed general provision enables the \nDepartment to more quickly respond to the rapidly changing needs for designated \nProcurement and RDT&E Agile Funding programs with a higher reprogramming threshold \nand an advance notification to Congress regarding any funding realignments, maximizing \nthe use of appropriated funds for their intended purpose.     \nSoftware Funding Flexibility:   This proposed general provision allows for O&M, \nProcurement, or RDT&E funding to be used  for expenses for the agile research, \ndevelopment, test and evaluation, procurement, production, modification, and operation \nand maintenance for software and digital technology programs.  This will reduce program \ndelays due to determining which appropriation is best used for which tasks and then \nensuring the correct alignment of funds, to include any required reprogramming actions,"

The accelerating pace of change on \nthe modern battlefield demands rapid adaptation to ensure the Army remains the dominant land \ncomponent of the Joint Force.  In response to growing threats and an increasingly contested \nglobal environment, in April 2025, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to launch the Army \nTransformation Initiative (ATI) —a comprehensive strategy to modernize the force for today’s \nfights and tomorrow’s challenges. \nATI places close combat formations at the center of its efforts, investing in critical technologies, \ndivesting outdated systems, and optimizing force structure.  This transformation directly supports \nSecretary Hegseth’s Department of Defense priorities:  R eestablishing Deterrence, Rebuilding \nOur Military, Reviving the Warrior Ethos, and Driving Reform and Optimization. \nThe FY 2026 budget request advances this transformation by funding long-range precision fires, \nSections \n• Department of the Army \n• Department of the Navy \n• Department of the Air Force \n• National Guard \n“Our Army must transform now to a leaner, more lethal force by infusing \ntechnology, cutting obsolete systems, and reducing overhead to defeat any \nadversary on an everchanging battlefield.” \n- Secretary of the Army Daniel P.

It also includes a proposal for a limited agile funding pilot, \nwhich consolidates budget lines in rapidly evolving technology portfolios, thereby ensuring the \nArmy can respond faster and more flexibly in the homeland, Indo-Pacific, and globally. \nTo make room for these investments, the Army will divest obsolete systems that can no longer \nsurvive the modern battlefield.  Structural changes —including command consolidations and \nheadquarters reductions —will optimize command alignment and force structur e, improve \noperational performance, and enhance lethality while preserving resources for the Army’s highest \npriorities.  These savings will be reinvested into key warfighting capabilities that provide the Army \nwith a critical advantage. \nBeyond transformation, the budget also sustains key enablers of readiness:  improved quality of \nlife for Soldiers and Families, a more resilient and responsive Organic Industrial Base (OIB), and \nfully resourced health and fitness initiatives to maintain a ready force. \nThe following sections outline how ATI directly supports the Department’s priorities and ensures \nits Soldiers can defend our Nation, at home and abroad. \nReestablishing Deterrence \nReestablishing deterrence begins with the Army realigning its forces and investments toward \nthreats in the Indo- Pacific—the Department’s priority theater —as well as other key geographic \nregions.  The Army is investing in critical capabilities , including long- range precision fires, \nhypersonic strike systems, and the MV -75 Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA), which \nprovides the speed, range, and lift required to operate effectively across the vast distances of the \nPacific and beyond.  These capabilities are essential to enabling the Joint Force to penetrate \ncontested environments, sustain operational tempo, and impose costs on adversaries. \nDeterrence must also be sustained at home.  The Army remains fully committed to its homeland \ndefense mission, with more than 10,000 Soldiers currently deployed to the southern border to \nsecure the United States’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to support the Department of \nHomeland Security and other federal agencies.  These operations include surveillance, aviation \nsupport, logistics, and the establishment of National Defense Areas (NDAs) to protect critical \ninfrastructure and secure the border.  Investments in sensors, counter -drone systems, and \nlayered defenses will further strengthen homeland security while enhancing the Army’s ability to \ndeter threats both domestically and abroad.  To improve unity of effort and reduce redundancy, \nthe Army will consolidate U.S. Army North, U.S. Army South, and U.S. Army Forces Command , \nstreamlining command and control for homeland operations. \nSustained deterrence also requires endurance.  Recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East \nunderscore the importance of a resilient industrial base.  For the Army and the broader Joint \nForce, the OIB provides the “magazine depth” essential to sustaining prolonged operations.  The \nArmy is modernizing nearly two dozen arsenals, depots, and ammunition plants.  The FY 2026 \nbudget prioritizes facility upgrades, increased munitions production, cyber hardening of industrial \nsystems, and workload optimization to maximize output and responsiveness.  Partnerships with \nthe Defense Industrial Base, including both new startups and traditional defense companies, is \nalso critical to sustaining deterrence.  Through cooperative agreements, co-production, and joint \nventures, the Army can leverage commercial solutions and advanced manufacturing methods to \nexpand its sustainment capabilities. \nTogether, these investments ensure the Army is postured to outpace, outfight, and outlast any \nadversary, while also providing critical, sustained support to the Joint Force."

The \nTransformation in Contact initiative launched this effort to field the most advanced available \ntechnologies while reshaping formations to be leaner, more agile, and more lethal.  Over the next \ntwo years, the Army will expand this effort by converting 25 Infantry Brigade Combat Teams \n(IBCTs) into Mobile BCTs (MBCTs), which are modernized formations equipped with Infantry \nSquad Vehicles (ISVs), loitering munitions, advanced rifles, night vision systems, and drones. \nThis will be followed by the transformation of seven Armored and Stryker BCTs, further enhancing \nmobility, firepower, and survivability across the force.  \nThe Army’s modernization efforts extend beyond the brigade level.  Fielding a critical mass of \nlong-range fires, modernizing unmanned systems, and building effective electronic warfare and \ncounter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (c -UAS) capabilities are central to  winning in contested \nenvironments.  To support this, new air and missile defense and fires units will be activated, and \ndivision-level artillery will be modernized to integrate drones and advanced targeting capabilities.  \nAt higher echelons, the Army will field Next-Generation Command and Control (NGC2) systems—\nadvanced digital networks powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning—to three \nDivisions and four Corps, dramatically enhancing decision speed, coordination, and operational \nreach.  \nArmy aviation is also undergoing major restructuring to improve lethality, survivability, and \nreadiness.  The inactivation of Air Cavalry Squadrons in the Active Component and the divestment \nof Reserve Component Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigades (ECABs) will allow the Army to \nreallocate these savings toward a more effective mix of next -generation rotary and unmanned \nplatforms optimized for operations in contested and denied airspace. \nRebuilding the Army also requires divesting legacy systems that no longer meet the demands of \nmodern warfare.  Informed by lessons learned in Ukraine, the Army is responding to the reality of \nubiquitous sensing and overwhelming volumes of threats from the sky.  This requires terminating \nfuture investments in the M10 Booker, High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), Joint Light \nTactical Vehicle (JLTV), Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV), and the MQ-1C Gray Eagle.  Divestment \nof these systems will improve unit survivability and mobility, as well as free up resources to \nreinvest in cutting- edge technologies that more directly enhance warfighting capability and \nreadiness. \nAdditionally, as part of the FY 2026 budget request, the Army is proposing a limited agile funding \npilot focused exclusively on the most rapidly evolving technology areas.  This pilot will consolidate \nselect budget lines within three capability portfolios:   Counter-small UAS (C -sUAS), \nUAS/Launched Effects, and Electronic Warfare (EW).  By streamlining funding in these specific \nportfolios, the Army aims to reduce procurement delays, increase flexibility, and accelerate the \nadoption of critical new technologies.  The focused scope of this program allows the Army to \neffectively test and refine agile budgeting practices, ensuring accountability and alignment with \ntransformation priorities. \n“Everywhere I go, I see highly motivated Soldiers willing to innovate, train and \nsacrifice for the mission, and we owe them the best. The tech we will infuse in \nour formations are not years away, they are available now.” \n– Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Randy A. George"

In concert with \nthe Department of Defense, the Army is advancing critical initiatives, including prioritized junior \nenlisted pay increases, modernization of barracks and family housing, expansion of child \ndevelopment centers, and enhanced access to essential services.  These efforts aim to support \nrecruiting, retention, and long-term readiness. \nThe FY 2026 budget request reflects this commitment by fully funding key initiatives.  It supports \nthe Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program, which strengthens Soldiers’ physical, mental, and \nspiritual resilience.  The Army is also redesigning its dining facilities, piloting modern, campus -\nstyle dining at five installations to replace outdated mess halls , ensuring Soldiers are fueled for \nperformance with a focus on nutrition and wellness. \nQuality of life on duty is equally important.  This budget request prioritizes funding for tough, \nrealistic training at home stations, combat training centers, and training deployments with joint \nand multinational exercises to ensure units remain ready and lethal.  \nSustained investment in the programs that train and support our most vital asset—the American \nSoldier—ensures they are ready to lead the fight in defense of our Nation.  \nReform and Optimization \nThe Army is committed to the Presidential and Department of Defense priorities of being fiscally \nresponsible as it drives meaningful reform.  It has eliminated programs and functions that do not \ndirectly support the force generation and combat environment of the future.  It is also streamlining \nheadquarters, reducing the workforce, and consolidating commands —while expanding our \nSoldier base—such as merging the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) with \nArmy Futures Command (AFC), to increase agility and efficiency across all echelons.  Further, \nthe Army is conducting focused reviews and audits of our formations, systems, and controls, and \nrefining our business processes, leading to optimized resource allocation.  \nThe Army made progress towards its audit goals in FY 2025, downgrading four and closing two \nmaterial weaknesses across its General Fund and Working Capital Fund.  Even with this success, \nthe Army is at a critical point in its mission to achieve a clean financial statement audit opinion.  \nTherefore, the Army is focused on closing additional material weaknesses and accelerating its \naudit emphasis in FY 2026.  The Army’s audit effort is critical to enhancing transparency, focusing \non technical innovations to more rapidly achieve and sustain auditability.  This enables resources \nto be aligned and executed in support of Army warfighting priorities to improve lethality and \nreadiness. \nThe divestment of legacy systems and outdated technologies has also garnered savings that the \nArmy is redirecting toward advanced capabilities to make Soldiers more lethal. \nThese efforts have eliminated waste, fostered innovation, and maximized every dollar given to \n“We need quality of life for present and future generations as we continue to \nfoster cohesive teams, maintain tactical and strategic readiness and sustain the \nmomentum of modernization.” \n– Sergeant Major of the Army Michael R. Weimer"

The key targets are: \n• Ready the force by eliminating ship, submarine, and aircraft maintenance delays. \n• Scale robotic and autonomous systems to integrate more platforms at speed. \n• Create the command centers our fleets need to win on a disturbed battlefield. \n• Recruit and retain the force we need to get more players on the field.  \n• Deliver a quality of service commensurate with the sacrifices of our Sailors. \n• Train for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually. \n• Restore the critical infrastructure that sustains and projects the fight from shore. \nThe events of the last two years in the Red Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Indo-Pacific \ndemonstrate the enduring importance of American naval power.  America’s Navy is a key pillar of \nnational power and a critical part of our Joint Force’s ability  to maintain peace through strength.  \nAchieving these seven key tasks will ensure a lethal, combat -credible Navy that contributes \nlayered effects to the Joint Force and can fight and win our Nation’s wars in the maritime \nenvironment."

The strategic priority remains the \ncontinued implementation of Force Design, the \nService-wide transformation effort to make the \nMarine Corps lighter, more naval, more versatile, \nand more lethal.   Modernizing the Corps in this \nway improves the ability to deter potential \nadversaries by providing credible forces for naval campaigns and expanding integration with the \nNaval and Joint Force, as well as our allies and partners.  Today, Marines are standing-in across \nmultiple theaters to disrupt adversary plans and prevent conflict.  If necessary, they are prepared \nto seize and defend key maritime terrain.  The concepts and capabilities stemming from Force \nDesign are being used today across the globe.\n \nCurrent and future readiness is a continuous process through a Campaign of Learning based on \nthe Marine Corps’ understanding of emerging and evolving threats, the trajectory of technology, \nand the missions the Corps is tasked to undertake.   Ongoing efforts to create and sustain \nwarfighting advantage over the long term will ensure the Fleet Marine Force remains organized, \ntrained, and equipped to succeed in an ever-evolving operational environment, regardless of time \nor place, maintaining its role as America’s premier expeditionary force -in-readiness, deterring \nadversaries, and responding to crises globally. \nTo best posture the Marine Corps for both the fights of today and the future, the CMC’s priorities \nfor the FY 2026 budget request, nested within the CPG, are as follows:  \nAmphibious Readiness and Littoral Mobility:   Achieving a sustained presence of three \nAmphibious Ready Groups with Marine Expeditionary Units is the Corps’ guiding goal.  These \nunits provide forward-deployed, lethal options that complicate adversary planning and enable \njoint campaigning with allies.   The Marine Corps is also advancing organic littoral mobility \ncapabilities to support low- profile Stand- in-Forces that operate within enemy threat zones \nthroughout conflict phases. \nAccelerate Force Design Modernization:   The Corps is committed to agility in adapting to \nevolving threats by integrating new technologies, refining its organizational structure, and \nstrengthening joint operations.  This commitment ensures Marines remain lethal, survivable, \nand ahead of adversaries as warfare evolves. \nModernize Barracks and Improve Quality of Life:  The Barracks 2030 initiative represents the \nlargest infrastructure investment in Marine Corps history, aimed at providing Marines with safe \nand modern living environments.  Enhancing quality of life through childcare, spousal \nemployment, and wellness programs is essential to readiness and retention. \nRecruit, Make, and Retain Marines:   The Marine Corps continues to meet recruiting goals \nwithout compromising standards, employing data-driven strategies to attract and retain high-\nquality Marines.  Supporting Marines and their families underpins the Corps’ ability to maintain \nan elite, ready force. \nThe CMC’s vision is to maintain a forward-leaning, versatile, and lethal Marine Corps capable of \nprevailing across all domains today and in the future."

The Natio n and our allies depend on \nthe Navy and Marine Corps team to sustain a lethal, agile, and ready force capable of responding \nto these evolving challenges. \nOur adversaries are not waiting.  China is building a navy to challenge American dominance.  \nChina continues to expand its fleet, build more advanced submarines, and operate more \nprovocatively and aggressively in contested waters.  If we fail to respond with urgency and \nresolve, we invite instability and risk ceding the seas to authoritarian influence. \nOur Sailors and Marines have met these threats with professionalism and bravery.  We must take \ndecisive action to deter China’s assertiveness and uphold peace through strength, ensuring the \nUnited States remains preeminent and fully prepared to defend its interests in every domain. \nIn the Indo -Pacific, China is pursuing rapid and \nconcerning growth, particularly in its naval \ncapabilities.  By 2030, China is projected to have \nnearly 1,000 nuclear warheads, with a significant \nportion carried by its growing fleet of ballistic \nmissile submarines.  By the end of this calendar \nyear, China is projected to surpass a significant \nmilestone with nearly 400 ships in its naval fleet – \na dramatic expansion.  This growth greatly \nenhances its strategic reach and power projection \ncapabilities.

These investments include multi- role air \nsuperiority capabilities and the capacity to defend \nthe homeland,  project airpower globally, and \noperate as a joint, allied and partner force.  While \ncrewed fighters will remain the core of Air Force \ncombat power, Collaborative Combat Aircraft \n(CCA) can provide risk-tolerant, combat-effective \nmass at an affordable cost .  The Future Fighter Force is tied to the F -47, which will provide air \nsuperiority in contested environments for the Joint Force in the 2030s.   The Air Force preserves \nprevious advances and invests across foundational accounts, while focusing resources on long-\nrange kill chain capabilities.  Our investments align with the national strategy to deliver warfighting \nsolutions for the Joint Warfighting Concept. \nThe USAF fighter force will be comprised of a mix of 4th, 5th, and next -gen fighters. We will \nmaintain fighter readiness while modernizing F -16s, F-15s, and F -22s to the maximum extent \npossible within fiscal constraints. Additionally, we will field Block 4  F-35s and the F -47 over the \nnext decade.  The F-22 modernization effort is focused on lethality, survivability, connectivity, and \npersistence in a highly contested environment (HCE). \nFamily of Systems directs the development of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) uncrewed \nsystems, autonomy development through the Viper Experimentation and Next -gen Ops Model, \nCCA uncrewed aircraft integration with existing platforms, and the continued standup of the CCA \nExperimental Operational Unit.  Our investment of $804.4 million will allow our Air Force to more \neffectively deter aggression and maintain air superiority in the air domain.  \nThe USAF must evolve its fighter force to meet the threat posed by our most consequential \nadversaries to ensure air superiority and dominance over peer adversaries, as well as provide \nthe capability and capacity to meet worldwide demands in the 2030s and beyond.  An integral \npart of this evolution is accelerating the development of uncrewed, collaborative combat platforms \nto increase combat capability and affordable capacity. \nOptimized Resilient Forward Basing requires that we ensure our bases and airfields are resilient, \nsustainable, and networked to provide effective and reliable sortie generation and mission \nexecution in a contested environment.  The Joint Force cannot successfully conduct operations \nat a rate needed to deter aggression in the Pacific without optimized resilient forward basing that \ncan remain functional and effective while under heavy attack.  Investment in infrastructure, agile \ncommunications, and base defense is critical to the success of this effort, and this budget includes \n$600.6 million to achieve this objective. \nGlobal Strike  \nContinued strategic nuclear deterrence promotes global stability and modernization and will \nprovide nuclear strike options for decades to come.  The FY 2026 budget funds nuclear \nmodernization and continues to recapitalize our contributions to the nation’s nuclear triad and \nNuclear Command, Control, and Communication (NC3).  The FY 2026 budget funds $4.5 billion \nfor the Sentinel system that replaces the +45-year Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile."

Investments \nfocus on an expeditious transition to the B-21 and modernizing the B-52 fleet.  We also continue \nsustaining the B-2 fleet to keep relevancy until divestiture.  The FY 2026 budget request includes \n$5.5 billion to support B-21 low-rate initial production to attain a nuclear-capable bomber force.  \nThe Air Force must build the right mix of hypersonic and long- range subsonic missiles. The  \nFY 2026 budget invests in capabilities that can strike at long distances, including hypersonics by \ninvesting $802.8 million in the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, $387.1M in the Air -Launched \nRapid Response Weapon (ARRW), and $1.1 billion in the Joint Air -to-Surface Standoff Missile \nExtended Range (JASSM-ER).  We aim to enable the industrial base to manufacture hypersonic \nsystems affordably and at the capacity necessary to provide a decisive advantage on the \nbattlefield. Similar to our previous request, the budget asks for multi -year procurement to build \ninventory levels for air dominance and global precision attack missions. The LRSO and JASSM-\nER must continue development and production to provide nuclear and conventional long- range \nstrike options.   \nLong-Range Strike Family of Systems directs the development and eventual employment of a \nlong-range strike family of systems, integrating the B-21 bomber with advanced communications, \nsensors, and a broad mix of weapons and supporting systems to conduct long- range strike \noperations in a highly contested environment.   \nThe DAF has a responsibility to invest in an affordable mix of both air-to-air and air -to-surface \nweapons that can deliver the capability and capacity needed to maintain a competitive advantage \nover our pacing challenge.  To this end, investment in capabilities that enable rapid test and \nproduction of new technologies with open system architectures in relevant quantities is necessary.  \nThe Air Force is investing $656.3 million in the Family of Affordable Mass Missiles. Key attributes \nof future munitions include Government-referenced Open Systems Architecture compliance that \nenables rapid, agile upgrades, as well as mesh- network compatibility, survivability, and \nexportability. \nRapid Global Mobility  \nIn FY 2026, the tanker Total Aircraft Inventory \n(TAI) remains at 466.  Modernizing the aging \ntanker fleet is a priority in the Rapid Global Mobility \nportfolio. The Air Force is investing $3.3  billion to \nrecapitalize the tanker enterprise, purchasing  \n15 KC-46As to support air operations worldwide. \nThe DAF maintains a tactical airlift C -130J/H TAI \nfleet of 271 aircraft.   Given the notable remaining \nservice life of the C -130H fleet, further \nrecapitalization of the C-130H is not needed.  The C-17A/C-5M aircraft TAI fleet remains at 274.  \nThe budget invests over $6.2 billion in key safety, modernization, and communication/connectivity \nmodifications across the tactical and strategic airlift fleets in FY 2026. \nThe Joint force must be able to effectively deploy, conduct, and sustain operations against peer \ncompetitors in highly contested environments.  A mix of survivable, connected, and agile mobility \nplatforms that reliably provide range, flexible payloads, and unique capabilities are necessary for \nsustaining operations in highly contested environments.  The FY 2026 budget sets options for \nfuture KC -46 production and provides the funding needed to establish a new tanker \nrecapitalization contract in the future while improving tanker survivability."

Investments are critical to counter advanced and emerging \nair threats fielded or in development by adversaries.   \nIn support of the modernization of our nuclear assets, the NC3 program is funded at $3.0 billion. \nAs the Department of Defense modernizes the three legs of the nuclear triad, we must also \nmodernize the communications systems and sensors that enable them to function; the \nDepartment of the Air Force provides 75 percent of the NC3 capabilities.   NC3 enables broader \nCombined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) initiatives and must be developed \nin synchronization with other CJADC2 efforts. \nThe DAF must develop and migrate to a C2 architecture capable of resilient, high-speed battle \nmanagement of a distributed, adaptive force and the operational ability to disaggregate execution \nwhen the threat requires it.  The DAF BATTLE NETWORK architecture will integrate numerous \nAir Force and Space Force programs by enabling distributed C2 at a variety of disaggregated \nlocations as dictated by the operational situation.  Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) \nis the program element that funds a subset of DAF BATTLE NETWORK capabilities, and will \nprovide the connectivity, secure processing, and data management capabilities needed to battle \nmanage DAF assets and contribute to the joint fight in a highly contested, dynamic, time -\ncompressed environment at scale.  The DAF BATTLE NETWORK is the DAF contribution to \nCJADC2. \nTransition to Wartime Posture focuses on posturing the Department to mobilize and transition to \nwar, as well as sustain operations in a contested environment, including supporting information \ntechnology systems.  The Air Force is investing $1.6 billion in the modernization of our information \ntechnology infrastructure and platforms, and in improving our cybersecurity and resilience. \nIntelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting  \nThe ability to win future high-end conflicts requires accelerating our transition of the Intelligence, \nSurveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISRT) force structure into a more survivable, \npersistent, and connected force.  We need congressional support to move away from legacy \nsystems that offer limited capability against peer competitors.  Future ISRT capabilities will deliver \ntime-relevant, tailor-made solutions against diverse operational problems to deliver target quality \nintelligence to the warfighter at speed and scale.  ISRT enterprise supports combatant \ncommanders while accepting a small risk by preparing to divest less survivable systems to focus \nresources on future capabilities. \nThe DAF is transitioning the ISR force structure into a more survivable, persistent, and connected \nforce with sensors in all domains providing time-relevant, target-quality intelligence at speed and \nscale.  In this budget, the Air Force is investing $1.3 billion in developing and sustaining a family \nof survivable, long-range, and persistent sensors. These sensing capabilities are underpinned by \nincreased investment in technologies necessary to complete, automate, and sustain long- range \nkill chains. These investments will integrate complex external data, optimize sensor tasking,"

Airborne assets can provide \nunwarned collection, greater collection sensitivity, and more accurate geolocations when utilized \ncooperatively with space-based sensors. \nThe DAF must achieve electromagnetic dominance to maintain the information advantage in \nhighly contested environments. Advanced electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) systems and \ninfrastructure will enhance operational effectiveness, particularly Electromagnetic W arfare, \nElectromagnetic Spectrum -Enabled Cyberspace Attack, and Electromagnetic Battle \nManagement.  The Air Force is investing $423.2 million to accelerate these efforts. To gain \nadvantage in the EMS, we must invest in capabilities to augment our current Electronic Attack \nsystems, help us characterize the EMS environment, command and control EMS operations \n(EMSO), and rapidly update and assess our aircraft EMS-sensing systems to adjust to real-time \nadversary changes. \nUnited States Space Force \nThe Space Force’s FY 2026 President’s Budget request aligns with national defense guidance \nand statutory roles of the Space Force to organize, train, and equip to provide freedom of \noperation for the United States in, from, and to space, conduct space operations, and protect the \ninterests of the United States in space.  \nSpace Control \nThe Space Force exists to fight and win in the space \ndomain, and the Service’s essential function is \nspace superiority – that is, the degree of control that \nallows our forces to operate at a time and place of \ntheir choosing without prohibitive interference from \nspace or counterspace threats, while also denying \nthe same to an adversary.  The Space Force will \nachieve space superiority  through space control, \nwhich includes the activities required to contest and \ncontrol the space domain, such as offensive and \ndefensive actions, referred to as counterspace operations.  \nSpace Force requests $8.2 billion for space control capabilities. \nGlobal Mission Operations \nSpace is central to all the other services carrying out their missions. The Space Force enables \nthe Joint Force to defend U.S. interests and defeat adversary aggression.  Space Global Mission \nOperations encompasses Space Force activities to deliver space capabilities to the Joint Force \nand the nation.  The FY 2026 budget request includes funding for capabilities that strengthen our \ndeterrence posture by preserving Joint Force freedom of action throughout the continuum of \nconflict, including negating adversary space-based ISR and closing long-range kill chain. \nSpace capabilities are also critical to defending the homeland and reestablishing deterrence. A \nstrong defense will deter adversary actions against the homeland. Through the FY 2026 budget \nrequest, the Space Force will support the development of Golden Dome, providing critical space \ncapabilities for sensing and tracking threats to the homeland.

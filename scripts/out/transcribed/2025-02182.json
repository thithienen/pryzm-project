Purpose. The threat of attack by ballistic, \nhypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial \nattacks, remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United \nStates. \nPresident Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective \ndefense against nuclear attacks, and while this program resulted \nin many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal \ncould be realized. And since the United States withdrew from the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development \nof limited homeland missile defense, official United States \nhomeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead \nof rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile \nlaunches.\nOver the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat \nfrom next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense \nand complex with the development by peer and near-peer \nadversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own \nhomeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities. \nSec. 2. Policy. To further the goal of peace through \nstrength, it is the policy of the United States that: \n(a) The United States will provide for the common defense \nof its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a \nnext-generation missile defense shield; \nThis document is scheduled to be published in the\nFederal Register on 02/03/2025 and available online at\nhttps://federalregister.gov/d/2025-02182, and on https://govinfo.gov"

Beginning in FY \n2009, the Overview Book fulfilled this role, and it is published each year as part of the President’s \nAnnual Defense Budget.   \nThe Overview is one part of an extensive set of materials that constitute the presentation and \njustification of the President’s Budget for FY 2025.  This document and all other publications for \nthis and previous Department of Defense (DoD) budgets are available from the public website of \nthe Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  http://comptroller.defense.gov.   \nThe Press Release and Budget Briefing, often referred to as the “Budget Rollout,” and the \nProgram Acquisition Costs by Weapons System book, which includes summary details on major \nDoD acquisition programs (i.e., aircraft, ground forces programs, shipbuildi ng, space systems, \netc.), are especially relevant.   \nNotable accomplishments and updates will be summarized in the forthcoming 2023 Annual \nPerformance Report (APR).  Unclassified versions of the Annual Performance Plan (APP) and \nAPR will be posted at https://dam.defense.gov/Performance/ when available. \nOther background information can be accessed at www.defense.gov. \n \n \nThe estimated cost of this report or study for the \nDepartment of Defense is approximately $40,000 \nfor the 2024 Fiscal Year.

      "text": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the \nPresident’s Fiscal Year 2025 Budget \nThe President’s budget request for the Department of Defense is once again rooted in our 2022 \nNational Defense Strategy, which continues to let us match our national resources to our national \nobjectives. This request will bolster our ability to defend our country, paced to the challenge posed \nby an increasingly aggressive People’ s Republic of China. It will better posture us to deter \naggression against the United States or our allies and partners, while also preparing us to prevail \nin conflict if necessary. It will continue to forge a more resilient joint force and a modern defense \necosystem, built for the security challenges of the 21st century. And it will strengthen the \nunmatched global network of alliances and partnerships that magnify our power and advance our \nsecurity. \nThis budget request is consistent with the mandatory caps approved by Congress under the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023. Under these caps, we made difficult, but responsible, decisions that \nfocus on maintaining our military’s readiness and taking care of our people. So our budget request \nreflects targeted reductions to programs that will deliver key capabilities in later years to support \nthe joint force’s ability to fight and win in the near term. \nWe must continue to invest in cutting-edge defense capabilities and to advance new operational \nconcepts across domains, from advanced cyber systems and enhanced space capabilities to a \nmodernized nuclear triad. This budget request also reflects a deep comm itment to our people, \nwho will always be the Department’s greatest strategic asset; we hope to raise basic pay, boost \nquality-of-life initiatives, and promote safety and accountability. Moreover, this request will enable \nthe Department to deepen cooperation with our interagency colleagues, Congress, industry, \nacademia, and our allies and partners. Through cooperative defense initiatives, multilateral joint \nexercises, and shared technology development, we will deepen our capabilities and help make \nAmerica and the world more secure. \nSince my first day as Secretary of Defense, I have focused on three priorities: defending the \nNation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. President Biden’s FY 2025 \nbudget request advances each of these priorities. \nAs Congress writes authorizing and appropriations legislation in the months ahead, I am grateful \nfor members’ support for the budget and the mission of the Department of Defense. \n– Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III"

FY 2025 BUDGET SUMMARY \n \n2022 NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY AND NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY \nThe President’s National Security Strategy \n(NSS) and the Secretary of Defense’s National \nDefense Strategy (NDS), both signed and \nreleased in 2022, fully informed the building of \nthe Fiscal Year 2025 budget request, resulting \nin a submission that is comprehensively aligned \nwith national strategic priorities. \nPresident’s National Security Strategy  \nThe NSS remains unchanged from last year’s budget.  Key tenets for the military in the NSS \ninclude: \n• By modernizing our military, pursuing advanced technologies, and investing in our defense \nworkforce, we will have strengthened deterrence in an era of increasing geopolitical \nconfrontation, and positioned America to defend our homeland, our allies, partner s, and \ninterests overseas, and our values across the globe. \n• The United States will continue to defend democracy around the world.  We will continue to \ninvest in boosting American competitiveness globally. We will partner with any nation that \nbelieves the rules-based order must remain the foundation for global peace and prosperity. \nAnd we will continue to demonstrate how America’s enduring leadership to address today’s \nand tomorrow’s challenges, with vision and clarity, is the best way to deliver for the American \npeople. \n• We are doing more to connect our partners and strategies across regions through initiatives \nlike our security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom (AUKUS) in support of the \nNSS. \nNational Defense Strategy – Defense Priorities \nLike the NSS, the NDS issued in 2022 remains \nunchanged.  It directs the Department to act \nurgently to sustain and strengthen U.S. military \ncredibility and deterrence capability.  The NDS  \nidentifies four top -level defense priorities the \nDepartment must pursue to strengthen \ndeterrence:   \n• First, the Department will defend the \nHomeland, with the PRC as the Department’s \npacing challenge. \n \nSections \n• 2022 National Security Strategy and \nNational Defense Strategy \n• FY 2025 Budget Request Overview \n• Resourcing the 2022 NDS \n• Conclusion \n“…only one country on Earth can provide the kind of leadership that this \nmoment demands. And only one country can consistently provide the powerful \ncombination of innovation, ingenuity, and idealism—and of free minds, free \nenterprise, and free people.  And that’s the United States of America.” \n- Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III at the Reagan National Defense Forum, December 2023"

The 2022 NDS advances \na strategy focused on the People’s Republic of China ( PRC) and seeks to prevent the PRC’s \ndominance of key regions, while protecting the U.S. homeland and reinforcing a stable and open \ninternational system.  Consistent with the 2022 NSS, a vital objective of the NDS is to dissuade \nthe PRC from considering aggression as a viable means of advancing goals that threaten vital \nU.S. national interests.  Conflict with the PRC is neither inevitable nor desirable.  The  \nDepartment’s priorities support broader whole -of-government efforts to develop terms of \ninteraction with the PRC that are favorable to our interests and values, while managing strategic \ncompetition and enabling the pursuit of cooperation on shared challenges. \nEven as we focus on the PRC as our pacing challenge, the NDS also accounts for the acute threat \nposed by Russia, demonstrated by our continued efforts to oppose Russian aggression in Europe \nand their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  The Department’s invest ments will continue robust \ndeterrence of Russian aggression against vital U.S. national interests, including commitments to \nour treaties.  We will work closely via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and with our \nallies and partners to develop critical enabling capabilities and deepen interoperability for a more \ncredible combined Allied force.  In service of the NDS strategic priorities, the Department will \naccept measured risk but remain vigilant in the face of other persistent threats, including those \nposed by North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations. \nSecurity Environment \nThe 2022 NDS provides the Department with a guiding framework that accounts for changes in \nthe geopolitical landscape.  In this complex and dynamic security environment, the Department \nwill continue to maintain its distinctive advantages in military capabi lities for the Total Force, \nenhance the ability to support and employ that force with allies and partners, and conduct military \nactivities that advance U.S. national interests.  \nAn increasing array of fast -evolving technologies and innovative applications of existing \ntechnology complicates the Department’s ability to maintain an edge in combat credibility and \ndeterrence.  Newer capabilities such as counterspace weapons, hypersonic  weapons, new and \nemerging payload and delivery systems, and lack of clarity for norms of behavior in space, cyber, \nand information domains continue to create a heightened potential for inadvertent escalation or \nshifts in perceived deterrence of U.S. milit ary power.  New applications of artificial intelligence, \nquantum science, autonomous weapons designs, biotechnology, and space technologies can \nchange traditional, kinetic military conflict, and disrupt the U.S. supply chain and logistics \noperations vital to maintaining combat credibility.  The Department likewise faces destabilizing \nand potentially catastrophic transboundary challenges, including climate change and pandemics, \nwhich have increasingly affected the Total Force."

Further underpinning and inextricably linked to the \nDepartment’s efforts to fully implement the 2022 NDS are the Secretary’s top three priorities – to \nDefend the Nation, Take Care of Our People, and Succeed through Teamwork.  These \noverarching tenets and strategic framework drive the FY  2025 budget to make the right \ninvestments for our warfighters and deliver deterrence through strength. \nFigure 1.1 DoD Budget \n$ in billions FY 2023 \nActuals \nFY 2024 \nRequest \nFY 2024 \nCR 2 \nFY 2025 \nRequest \nBase 815.9 842.0 817.3 849.8 \nSupplementals1 35.8 58.3 -- -- \nTotal 851.7 900.3 817.3 849.8 \nDiscretionary Budget Authority  Numbers may not add due to rounding \n1 FY 2023 includes supplemental funding for Ukraine ($35.7 billion) and Disaster Relief ($147 million).  FY 2024 includes \nsupplemental funding request for Ukraine ($44.4 billion), Israel ($10.6 billion), and Submarine Industrial Base ($3.3 billion). \n2 Reflects Continuing Resolution (CR) (P.L. 118-15), as amended \nThe President’s FY  2025 budget request for DoD is $849.8 billion.  This budget represents a \n$33.9 billion or 4. 2 percent increase over the FY  2023 base level of $815.9 billion (or a \n$32.4 billion (4.0 percent) increase over the FY 2024 Continuing Resolution (CR)).  However, as \nthis request is aligned to the funding levels agreed to in the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of \n2023, it  grows by only $7.8 billion (0.9 percent) over the FY  2024 President’s Budget request .  \nWhile this budget continues to make the investments necessary to implement and execute the \n2022 NDS, the FRA topline limitation required the Department to make some targeted reductions \nto programs that will not deliver capabil ity to the force until the 2030s  to pr eserve and enhance \nthe Total Force’s ability to fight and win in the near term.  Examples of these targeted reductions \nin the FY 2025 budget request in clude the rephasing of the Navy ’s Next Generation Fighter \nprogram and Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program, and the reduction of Space \nForces’ demonstration and experimentation tranche.  The FY 2025 budget request ensures the \nDepartment can sustain and strengthen integrated deterrence and investments that build \nenduring advantages, including:  supporting our servicemembers and their families; strengthening \nour alliances and partnerships; and preserving America’s technological edge.   \nTo ensure the Department stays on track, the FY  2023 – FY 2026 Strategic Management Plan \n(SMP) directly aligns to the 2022 NDS’s building enduring advantages approach, focusing on \nstrengthening the Department's management capabilities to  implement the NDS successfully.  \nThis includes expeditiously pursuing the financial audit and implement ing corrections into our \nbusiness processes .  Both initiatives drive sustainable reform , improved efficiency  and \neffectiveness, and increased public confidence in the DoD’s stewardship of funds.  The FY 2025 \nbudget identifies $1.3  billion in Performance Improvement Initiative cost reductions across the \nDepartment achieved through Continuous Process Improvements (CPI), Optimization, Reform, \nand Transformation initiatives.  These collective actions enable the Services and the Department \nto reinvest and redirect resources to higher national defense priorities.   \nFigure 1.2 provides a historical look at the overall DoD budget back to FY 2010  and breaks out \nthe base budget amounts from Overseas Contingency Operations ( OCO), and other \nsupplemental funding received.

The consequences would be \ngrave.  We will continue to take care of our people by ensuring military manpower accounts are \nprotected from further reductions under sequestration, but this will exert tremendous pressure on \nprocurement and readiness accounts to absorb the indiscriminate, across-the-board spending cut \nrequired under sequestration.  The Department will risk undoing years of steady efforts to improve \nreadiness and rapidly modernize to meet our pacing threat.  S equestration would reduce the \nDepartment’s funding, impair  our missions, use taxpayer money inefficiently , and deprive our \nindustry partnersthe stability required to build and maintain the systems vital to our defense."

However, the goal of the \nprocess remains unchanged and the challenges we face from our adversaries continue to be \nformidable. \nThe U.S. has had many adversaries before that were actively trying to change the world order, \nbut none have been successful.

As we \nmove forward into the decisive decades ahead, the Department mus t continuously evaluate our \ncapabilities and technologies available for the warfighters.  But we must also continually improve \nthe processes that underpin how we delivery those capabilities and close gaps.

While their work is quickly coming \nto a close, the Department’s is just beginning.  In the coming weeks, as each of these proposed \nchanges are assessed, the Department will be looking at each to determine if it improves the \nDepartment’s processes significantly enough to justify the cost to taxpayers.  For some \nrecommendations, the cost of time and dollars to implement will be considerable.   The \nDepartment will require time to review the changes proposed and analysis underpinning the more \ncostly and far -reaching recommendations.  We look forward to the coming discussions with \nCongress, the Office of Management and Budget, and our Department stakeholders.  \nThe FY 2025 President’s Budget request includes the following reforms: \n• Operation and Maintenance Unobligated Balance Carryover:   This proposed general \nprovision would allow the Department to carry over up to 50 percent of unobligated balances \nin the Operation and Maintenance accounts into the next fiscal year. This change reinforces \ngood fiscal stewardship by giving financial managers a tool to make better year-end spending \ndecisions and enables the Department to respond to emergent requirements. \n• Increases to Below Threshold Reprogramming Limits:   The Department seeks to work \nwith the congressional defense committees to increase the reprogramming thresholds for all \nappropriations titles to amounts that are more consistent with historical percentages of \ninflation and the DoD budget .  Examples include  $15 million for Military Personnel funding, \n$30 million for Operation and Maintenance funding, $25  million for Research, Development, \nTest, and Evaluation, and $40 million for Procurement.  The proposed thresholds are based \non those identified in the conference report of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act \nof Fiscal Year 2003 and increased commensurate to the overall growth in funding by \nappropriation title.  This increase is needed to minimize delays in the execution of funds and \nprovide greater flexibility to address unanticipated requirements in the year of execution.   \n• Two-Year Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Funding:   This proposal (appropriations \nlanguage) changes the PCS funding availability period from one to two years in the military \npersonnel appropriations for the Active Components.  This change maximizes the utilization \nof PCS funds, which typically cross fiscal years because of the seasonal nature of PCS moves \nand minimizes the unexpended balances in the military personnel appropriations for the Active \nComponents – ultimately allowing the DoD to maximize the us e of congressionally \nappropriated funds for their intended purpose."

This \nflexibility ensures maximum execution of the Innovative Readiness Training opportunities that \nwill help increase deployment readiness , while simultaneously providing key services with \nlasting benefits for our American communities.  \n• Health Care Transformational Fund:  This proposal (general provision) allows the Defense \nHealth Program (DHP) to transfer unobligated balances of expiring discretionary funds in any \nof its accounts into a Transformation Fund.  This change helps the DHP target structural \ninvestments, such as the backlog in Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization, \nand enable DoD to maximize its health care investments without additional topline increases. \nCONCLUSION  \nThe Department  remains committed to the alignment of the FY 2025 budget to the nation’s \nstrategic goals and continues to strengthen the ties that bind the defense budget to the NDS.  The \nFY 2025 President’s Budget clearly articulates a plan to resource our forces today while outpacing \nthe threats identified in the NDS.  It wholistically addresses the resources our nation needs to \nprovide for defense, from investments in the industrial base and personnel wellness to increasing \nour ability to research and procure cutting edge technology.  This overview book is submitted to \nsupport our enduring promise to serve as responsible stewards of taxpayer funds and provide \nopen and transparent information."

INTEGRATED DETERRENCE \nINTRODUCTION \nIntegrated Deterrence is the first of three ways \nthe Department will address its goals identified \nin the 2022 National Defense Strategy.  It is a \nholistic concept that involves the application of \nmultiple deterrence logics —deterrence by \ndenial, deterrence by resilience, deterrence by \ndirect cost imposition, and deterrence through \nimposing costs on adversaries collectively with \nallies and partners—while integrating across the instruments of national power by working with \nU.S. government interagency partners, as well as internationally, with allies and partners.   \nIn protecting the Homeland, the Department continues to build resilience and combat credibility, \nthereby lowering the anticipated benefits of and raising the direct costs of using force.  For \nexample, the Department continues to maintain credible and effective deterrence of both large-\nscale and limited nuclear attacks from a range of adversaries and is improving U.S. forces’ ability \nto operate during or after limited nuclear,  chemical, and biological attacks.  The Department \ncontinues modernizing nuclear forces, Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3), \nand cooperating with the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration efforts \nto modernize the nuclear weapon production enterprise.   \nTo deter attacks by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the United States, its forces, or \nthose of U.S. allies and partners, the Department continues its efforts to enhance the capabilities \nand resilience of those systems that the PRC is most likely to target and seek interoperability , \ninterchangeability, and enhanced readiness through combined exercises.  \nTo deter attacks by Russia, the Department continues to build capability and credibility that \nreinforces our treaty commitments regardless of conventional or nuclear -armed attack.  In the \nshort run, the Department will improve resilience and focus on interoperability, intelligence \nsharing, and extended nuclear deterrence.  The Department is also focused on enhancing denial \ncapabilities and key enablers in North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) force planning, while \nNATO allies seek to bolster their con ventional warfighting capabilities.  For Ally and partner \ncountries that border Russia, the Department continues supporting efforts to build response \noptions.   \nThe Department will continue to deter North Korean and Iranian attacks by increasing partner \ncapability and resilience, particularly in air and missile defense.  To deter North Korean attacks, \nthe Department will continue close coordination and interoperability with our Republic of Korea \nAlly; nuclear deterrence; resilience initiatives; and the potential for direct cost imposition \napproaches that come from globally deployable Joint Forces.  In the Middle East, the Department \ncontinues providing security assistance where needed. \n  \nSections \n• Introduction \n• Deter Nuclear Employment and \nStrategic-Level Attacks \n• Major Weapons Programs \n“We must embrace integrated deterrence, which charges us to coordinate our \nefforts across all war-fighting domains, theaters, and the spectrum of conflict \nto create new and more complex dilemmas for our adversaries.\" \n- Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Message to the Force, March 2, 2023"

For the foreseeable future, nuclear weapons \nwill continue to provide unique deterrence effects that no other element of U.S. military power can \nreplace.  The Department is committed to moderniz ing its nuclear forces, NC3, production and \nsupport infrastructure, scientific and engineering base, and sustaining fielded systems through \nthe transition to their replacements.  Most of the Nation’s nuclear deterrence delivery systems  \nwere built in the 1980s and prior .  After multiple life extensions, all currently fielded systems will \nreach end -of-service life in the mid-2030s timeframe.  The Department has steadily received \nstrong, bipartisan congressional support for nuclear modernization, and these programs are \nfunded in the FY 2025 budget request.  Replacement programs are underway to ensure there are \nno gaps in capability when the legacy systems age-out, but there is little schedule margin between \nthe fielded system age-out and the fielding of the replacement systems .  Recapitalizing nuclear \nplatforms, delivery systems, and the associated support systems will require significant \ninvestment over the next 20 years.

Providing s upport to warfighters via \nSatellite Communications (SATCOM) downrange \nis a paramount responsibility of the Space Force.  \nThe Space Force continues development efforts on future disaggregated strategic and tactical \nSATCOM systems to meet emerging threats in the 2030s timeframe.  Readiness through \nrelationship-building also includes integration with international partners , commercial SATCOM, \nand various acquisition pathways to rapidly deliver capability .  Various investments are being \nmade to the following programs to continue to deliver capability in the event of conflict:  Protected \nTactical SATCOM , Protected Tactical Enterprise Service , Mobile User Objective System , \nCommercial SATCOM Integration (developing  tools to operate SATCOM as a single, hybrid \nenterprise), Wideband Global SATCOM, and Polar SATCOM.  \nThis year’s budget request highlights specific modernization efforts to improve Global Positioning \nSystem’s (GPS) resiliency.  Commercial, civil, allied, partner, and military users depend on \nassured positioning, navigation, and timing systems for precise and accurate geolocation,  \nnavigation, and time reference services.  These capabilities are mission -essential for virtually \nevery modern weapon system.  Specific enhancements include increased anti -jamming \nperformance, military user equipment upgrades, and advanced ground operating system cyber \nprotection.  \nThe Space Force continues to drive readiness through its investment into a Force Design \napproach to delivering new capabilities.  Capabilities on- orbit today were not designed for a \nwarfighting domain; therefore, the Space Force is investing in resilient architectures designed for \na contested space domain.  Through the Space Warfighting Analysis Center, the Space Force is \nutilizing a cost-conscious, threat-informed, data-driven force design process to deliver a series of \nrobust space architecture designs that advance joint force capabilities.  These analytic efforts in \nconjunction with inputs from stakeholders across DoD, the Intelligence Community, and our allies \nand partners help shape future requirement strategies to ensure the Service invests in the right \ncapabilities to effectively and efficiently meet future needs.  Based on the ever -changing \nenvironment of the spac e domain, force design analysis hinges on detailed threat information.  \nThe Space Force derives this information from the National Space Int elligence Center, which \narticulates threats and provides updates, assessments of adversary capabilities, and intent in the \nspace domain. \nAll of these capabilities, comprised of over 50 weapon systems, are supported by the Space Force \nWeapon Systems Sustainment and FSRM.  The Space Force is prioritizing these efforts to ensure \noptimized readiness across all aspects of the Space Force portfolio. \nIn support of the 2022 NDS, the Space Force continues to evolve operational training to ensure \nGuardians can defeat realistic threats and continue to enhance the effectiveness of the Joint \nForce.

Specific investments include funding that:  modernizes \nMH-47 and MH -60 capabilities to operate in complex and environmentally challenging terrain; \nleverages adaptive airborne enterprise capabilities and unmanned system autonomy initiatives \nand interoperability to advance air, ground, and maritime systems to a multi-domain, agile, small \nfootprint, mesh-network command and control ecosystem; modernizes SOF training ranges and \nsimulators; enables full -spectrum SOF-specific training events and exercises; expands training \nintegration with the conventional forces; sustains flying-hours for SOF fixed-wing and rotary-wing \naircraft; and supports the Preservation of the Force and Family program to maximize personnel \nreadiness. \nThe FY 2025 budget sustains resources to support SOF readiness training and exercises.  These \ninclude SOF participation in support of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-directed training \nand priority exercises within every Geographic Combatant Commander ’s area of responsibility \nand execution of USSOCOM Component exercises to provide training, validation, and certification \nof O-6 and above Joint SOF Headquarters preparing to deploy for named operations , which are \ncrucial to sustaining SOF readiness.  The FY  2025 budget sustains the USSOCOM Joint \nCombined Exchange Training program, which is crucial to the Mission Essential Task List training \nand continued readiness of small U.S. SOF units to train overseas with friendly foreign forces.  \nThe FY  2025 budget request continues to invest in recapitalization and modernization efforts \ncritical to rebuilding SOF platform readiness and enhancing the capacity of certain high-demand, \nlow-density force elements to improve readiness.  The budget request supports SOF's \nsustainable force generation models to meet DoD's deployment-to-dwell goals while maintaining \nconsistent force offerings and employment .  These relatively small but crucial capacity \nenhancements include expanded capabilities to reduce str ess on SOF enablers, initiatives to \nimprove SOF aviation platform availability, as well as support Intelligence, Surveillance, and \nFigure 3.16.

To \nmaintain decisive military advantage over peer adversaries in multi-domain operations, the DoD \nis changing its approach to developing training capabilities by elevating training investment, \nreforming business practices, and prioritizing commonality and interoperability.  The framework \nfor this change is the Secretary’s Joint Operational Training Infrastructure Strategy. Selected \ntraining initiatives in the FY 2025 President’s Budget include: \n1. Joint Simulation Environment (JSE) and Joint Integrated Training Centers (JITCs) \nGiven its high-fidelity capability, the JSE is expanding beyond its original use for F -35 synthetic \nenvironment testing to an all -domain pacing threat readiness environment for the Joint Force.  \nThe JITC will be a government-owned center operating the JSE, mitigating the air combat training \nlag challenge and filling fidelity gaps by co-locating simulator bays of tier-one assets (F-35, F-22, \nNext Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), EA -18G, B-21, E-7, E-2D, AEGIS, Patriot, THAAD, \nHIMARS, Space, and Cyber) in a single facility.  Full operational capacity of the JITC will offer a \npath for tier-one operators to train in an all -domain pacing threat scenario that is not offered by \nany other technology.  From a workforce management perspective, all Joint Force trainees are \nco-located during the training event, creating a learning environment that does not exist across a \ndistributed exercise. \n2. Pacific Maritime Training and Experimentation Capability (PMTEC) and European Maritime \nTraining and Experimentation Capability (EMTEC) \nThe USINDOPACOM’s PMTEC will provide the ability to train the Joint Force, allies, and partners \nvia linkages between ranges.  The PMTEC will form the world’s largest fully instrumented coalition \nrange system with the most advanced capabilities for virtualization, simulation, and operational \nrehearsal over long distances via integrated Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) t raining.  \nThe PMTEC’s initial success has spurred the creation of EMTEC to leverage these successful \nefforts in the European theater. \n3. Joint Advanced Fires Qualification (JAFQ) Course  \nThe JAFQ course will teach advanced instructors from across the joint fires, teaching how \noperational warfare is conducted against pacing and acute threats.  This is one of the core \nsolutions to producing the expert operators and advisors for efforts such as the Combined Joint \nAll-Domain Command and Control initiative.  This course will leverage existing schoolhouse \nstructures across the DoD and produce graduates who will provide operational and planning \ninsight for the Military Services, Joint Staff, and Combatant Commands. \n4.  Joint Modular Emitter Interphase Standards (JMEIS) \nThe JMEIS will leverage ongoing test and training threat emulator efforts to produce a joint \nstandard for industry to build to and the Department to acquire in order to fill the gap in \nElectromagnetic Spectrum systems for warfighter training purposes.  These standards include the \nintegration of major emitter components, data and electronic file requirements, and range \ninfrastructure controls.  The JMEIS effort will fill the training gap created by a reliance on limited \nexquisite test fidelity emitters and extremely low-cost, low-capability emitters. \n5.

The OSD Blue Team will be the Department’s dedicated \nteam to ensure joint and coalition operational warfighting is set against credible key operational \nproblems.   \n6.  Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) \nThe PCTE will be the Department’s primary Cyberspace Operations training and certification  \nsource.  By the end of Phase II (FY 2024-2028), the PCTE will support end-to-end (individual-to-\ncollective) training for the full range of cyberspace forces, both Cyberspace Operations Forces \n(COF) and non-COF.  The PCTE platform provides a competitive edge over our adversaries and \nhas the ability to deliver those same advantages to allies and partners.  Expanded access to the \nPCTE allows Combatant Commands to meet th eir Theater Security Cooperation goals and \nfacilitates National Guard cooperation with State Partnership Program nations. \nJoint Training, Exercise, and Evaluation Program (JTEEP)  \nThe JTEEP is the Department’s primary way to prepare U.S. forces for globally integrated joint \nand combined operations across the competition continuum.  It provides resources to Combatant \nCommands (CCMDs) and Military Departments to enable individual and collective training of U.S. \nforces to improve joint readiness, prepare for high- end joint warfighting, and support day -to-day \ncampaigning activities.  The program requests $696.4 million for FY 2025 to support these basic \nendeavors.  \nThe CCMDs use JTEEP funding for both warfighting preparedness and day -to-day competition. \nAnnual funding for JTEEP enables the execution of over 100 major CCMD exercises that prepare \nU.S. forces to execute operational plans , train CCMD staffs in demanding and realistic \nenvironments, provide presence and regional expertise for U.S. allies  and partners, and build \nrelationships and trust.  The JTEEP also includes Exercise-Related Construction (ERC) funding \nto build exercise-related infrastructure needed by U.S. forces participating in joint exercises.  \nThe notable functions and elements of the JTEEP enterprise are highlighted below supporting the \nCombatant Commands.  \n• U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM):  JUDICIOUS RESPONSE is the Command’s premier \nexercises, and the means by which the Combatant Commander links the Joint Exercises \nProgram to the Joint Warfighting Concept.  On alternating years, JUDICIOUS RESPONSE \ncertifies USAFRICOM’s ability to serve as the Joint Forces Command, and U.S. Army Europe \nand Africa’s ability to serve as a Joint Task Force. JUDICIOUS RESPONSE also integrates \nUSAFRICOM with the globally integrated operations, including the Globally Integrated War \nGame, Globally Integrated Exercises, and Globally Integrated Campaign of Learning. The \nUSAFRICOM, in its support to the Joint Warfighting Concept, will seek to create dilemmas for \nU.S. adversaries, prevent strategic distraction, and facilitates access, bas ing, and overflight \nacross Africa.  In addition, USAFRICOM is synchronizing multiple regional JTEEP events to \noperationalize the Command’s East and West Africa approaches and emphasizes all domain \ncompetencies.  In the West, USAFRICOM is aligning AFRICAN LION’s all- domain activities, \nOBANGAME EXPRESS’ maritime activities, and FLINTLOCK’s special operations countering \nviolent extremist organizations (CVEO) activities.  In the East, USAFRICOM is aligning \nJUSTIFIED ACCORD’s land-force activities with CUTLASS EXPRESS’ maritime activities.  In \nthe south, the Command is making efforts to strengthen relationships with South Africa and \nother Southern African Development Community partners and are alternating Exercise \nSOUTHERN / SHARED ACCORD between Botswana and Sou th Africa.  Aligning these \nJTEEP events increases strategic impact, amplifies the U.S.’s strategic messaging, and \ndemonstrates the capabilities and reach of the Joint Force.

BUILDING ENDURING ADVANTAGES  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe 2022 National Defense Strategy identifies \nBuilding Enduring Advantages to shore up the \nfoundations for integrated deterrence and \ncampaigning, through investments in the Total \nForce, focus on innovation and rapid \nadjustments to new strategic demands, and \nefforts to make ourselves more resilient.  This \napproach calls for investments in the \nDepartment’s Total Force  (TF)—recognizing \nthat the Department needs to attract and recruit \ntalent to enhance the future workforce and \ndevelop, train, and promote its current \nworkforce.  This effort begins by cultivating the \nworkforce we need, investing in our most critical \nasset, our people.  The Budget provides a 4.5 percent pay raise for our military personnel and 2.0 \npercent pay raise for our civilian personnel, supports recruiting efforts by funding the necessary \nand critical expansion of the Joint marketing and advertising capabilities, invests in universal pre-\nkindergarten, and ensures continued investment in childcare, spouse employment and other force \nmultipliers. \nTo transform the foundation of the future TF , the Department continues to overhaul its force \ndevelopment, design, and business management practices, investing in cutting- edge \ntechnologies, interoperability, and cost -effectiveness over the longer term, and strengthening \nefforts to withstand, recover, and reconstitute the TF in a conflict or other contingency, as well as \nrewarding rapid experimentation, acquisition, and fielding.  The Department continues to pursue \ndivestment from systems less relevant to adv ancing the current force planning guidance and to \nsupport more relevant modernization efforts in the force and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) \nthat support that force.  By  strategically divesting vulnerable platforms and systems that can no \nlonger be affordably modernized or maintained,  investing in and enhancing the workforce, \nworkforce management, and business management processes, and prioritizing investments that \nmodernize or grow flexibility for the future, the Department gains advantages that, over time, will \nmake the Department more flexible, more responsive, and ultimately more capable. \nBuilding enduring advantages means the Department must continue innovating and modernizing, \nenabling technical breakthroughs and integrating emerging technologies to strengthen national \nsecurity and enhance defense capabilities.  Of the $143 .2 billion we invest  in Research, \nDevelopment, Test , and Evaluation (RDT&E), $17.2 billion is dedicated to science and \ntechnology.  Within these categories, we invest significantly in maturing artificial intelligence (AI) \nand Future Generation (FutureG)/5G programs. \nAchieving an enduring advantage also requires investments in the Nation’s DIB.  In line with our \nstrategy, the Department will focus on key industrial base sectors such as microelectronics; \ncasting and forging; batteries and energy storage; kinetic capabilities; and strategic and critical \nminerals and materials.  The budget request  makes significant investments in all these areas to \ncreate more resilient and secure supply chains. \nFinally, climate change and extreme weather events are amplifying operational demands on the \nmilitary, degrading infrastructure and systems, and posing risks to supply chains, especially in \naustere locations.  The D oD recognizes the need for climate adaptation efforts that align with \nSections \n• Introduction  \n• The DoD Strategic Management Plan \n• Taking Care of Our People \n• Transform the Foundation of the Future \nForce \n• Make the Right Technology Investments \n• Strengthen Resilience and Adaptability \n• Addressing Management Institutional \nPriorities"

This requires embracing an \ninnovative approach to meet emerging strategic \ndemands – through swift modernization, more \nresilient and  agile support systems for the \nDepartment in the face of all threats, and \ncultivating our talented workforce with the skills, \ncharacter, and diversity our Nation needs to \novercome today’s national security challenges.   \nThe Department’s Strategic Management Plan (SMP) for Fiscal Years 2022 –  2026 articulates \nthe Secretary of Defense’s strategic management priorities, consistent with the NDS, \nemphasizing building enduring advantages.  It presents the strategic management objectives the \nDoD plans to accomplish by providing a framework for describing general and long- term goals, \nwhat actions the Department will take to realize those goals, and how the DoD wi ll address \nchallenges and risks that may hinder achieving results.  The SMP meets statutory requirements \nunder the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 \n(GPRAMA), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A -11, requiring federal \nagencies to develop and submit an Agency Strategic Plan.  \nIn addition to the SMP, the Department communicates its commitment to strategic planning and \nperformance management each year  by publishing an Annual Performance Plan (APP) and \nAnnual Performance Report (APR) concurrently with the President’s budget request.  This year’s \nedition of the SMP includes the Department’s FY  2025 APP and FY  2023 APR.  The  \nFY 2025 APP complements the SMP’s longer-term planning outlook by linking its strategic goals \nand objectives to more short-term operational performance goals, measures, and targets for the \nupcoming fiscal year.  This year's significant improvement is that for the first time, the FY  2025 \nAPP strategic framework and the Budget Overview Book have the same content structure for \nstrategic priorities.  The FY  2023 APR consolidates prior fiscal year achievements and \nperformance results across all DoD Components and communicates overall implementation \nprogress against the SMP.  Unclassified versions of the FY 2025 APP and FY 2023 APR can be \nfound at https://dam.defense.gov/Performance-Mgmt/.  \nThe Department’s SMP articulates the NDS approach for Building Enduring Advantages around \nfive key strategic priorities:    \n• Taking Care of our People and Cultivating the Workforce We Need \n• Transform the Foundation of the Future Force  \n• Making the Right Technology Investments"

As the Department resources these priorities in the FY  2025 budget and \ncontinues implementation of the Building Enduring Advantages approach, the Department will \nclosely track the implementation of the SMP strategic framework using “Pulse,” the Department’s \nauthoritative performance management executive analytics dashboard that leverages big data \nand analytics tools in Advana.   \nPresident’s Management Agenda and Cross-Agency Priority Goals   \nThe President’s Management Agenda (PMA) sets forth the administration’s top priorities for \nimproving the way Government works.  These priorities are:   \n1. Strengthening and Empowering the Federal Workforce \n2. Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience \n3. Managing the Business of Government to Build Back Better    \nSince the PMA’s initial rollout in November 2021, the DoD has provided leadership and expertise \nto key cross -agency efforts to develop innovative solutions to address the most pressing \nmanagement challenges facing the Federal workforce and the people and communities Federal \nAgencies serve.  In 2023,  the focus shifted to implementation of solutions, including executing  \nseveral successful pilot efforts in support of each PMA Priority.  The DoD is committed to the \nsuccess of these efforts and will continue to support implementation activities through 2024 as \ncross-agency teams work to achieve the goals of the Administration’s management priorities.     \nPerformance Improvement Officer Role in PMA Integration  \nWithin the DoD, the Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) and Director, Administration and  \nManagement (DA&M) play a key role in developing and implementing the SMP.  Many of the SMP \nstrategic priorities, strategic objectives, and performance goals directly align to the PMA priorities.  \nFor example, Taking Care of Our People elements are directly linked to PMA Priorities 1 and 2, \nand several acquisition and procurement elements of Transform the Foundation of the Future \nForce portions align to PMA Priority 3.  In addition to ensuring the linkage between the PMA and \nSMP, the PIO/DA&M also chairs the DoD / OMB Chief Executive Officers ( CXO) Committee, a \nsupporting tier of the Defense Performance Improvement Council, which helps to align DoD’s \nprogress on the implementation of the PMA with OMB-led CXO council cross-agency initiatives, \nto share best practices on how DoD can support the interag ency, and to provide updates to the \nDPIC on interagency initiatives.   \nDoD Engagement in PMA Implementation  \nAs co-Priority Area Lead (PAL) Priority 1 (Workforce), the Deputy Secretary of Defense leverages \nthe Deputy’s Workforce Council and the considerable expertise of the Department to partner with \nother federal agencies in strengthening and empowering the Federal Workforce.  In collaboration \nwith the other PALs, the Deputy, supported by Office of the Under Secretary of Defense \n(Personnel and Readiness) (OUSD(P&R)) and OPIO-DA&M, has guided efforts to build a culture \nof workforce data across the Federal Governme nt, enhancing the experience for early career \ntalent and expanding cross-agency hiring.

Throughout 2024, DoD will continue to support these efforts, focusing on delivering \nimportant solutions for our transitioning veterans and providing excellent customer service to all \nFederal Agencies for background investigations.    \nFor Priority 3 (Managing the Business of Government), the DoD has continued to contribute \nsignificantly to developing solutions to improve the Federal acquisition system.  The Office of the \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (OUSD(A&S)) remains engaged with \nOMB and other agencies in activities to create a more diverse and resilient Federal marketplace, \nincluding solutions supporting Made in America (MiA).  The OUSD(A&S) is also actively engaged \nin each of the four pillars of the new Better Contracting Initiative (BCI).  The DoD is an active \nmember of the newly created Council on Federal Financial Assistance (COFFA), which will \naddress issues of standardization and modernization of the Federal assistance award \ninfrastructure to provide a better user experience for grantees and improve DoD analytics for \nmission performance. \nFor detailed information and updates on the Defense Department’s contributions to the PMA and \nrelated Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals, please refer to www.Performance.gov.   \nTAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE AND CULTIVATE THE WORKFORCE WE NEED \nThe DoD  TF Workforce (Military —  Active, Reserve, and National Guard — and Civilian \npersonnel) is the foundation of the Department and constitutes its most valued asset.  As such, \nDoD personnel must have the Nation's full support  to ensure the DoD accomplishes the \nfoundational mission of defending the United States.  That means the DoD must have the right \nskills and human capital resources in the right places, at the right time, at the proper levels, and \nwith the right skills to provide for the Nation’s defense, while simultaneously being good stewards \nof taxpayers’ dollars.  Recruiting, developing, and retaining a highly skilled military and civilian \nworkforce of diverse talent is essential for warfighting success.  The budget submission is \ndesigned to strengthen the ability to achieve a Total Force reflective of the vast diversity and \ntalents of our Nation, and ensure the Department is prepared to provide the forces needed to \ndeter attacks and aggression,  and keep the Nation secure.  We must invest in human capital \ninitiatives to compete for, hire, develop, and retain highly skilled experts in the ever -changing \ntalent acquisition landscape.   \nThe FY 2025 budget request will diversify and dynamically shape the workforce's mix of skills and \nexpertise to meet mission needs cost-effectively now and in the future. \nThe Secretary of Defense has identified Taking Care of People as one of his top priorities.  Only \nwith the right people and constructive, inclusive workplace practices will we be able to cultivate \nthe workforce we need.  The FY  2025 budget request and inv estments we are making will help \nus recruit, train, develop, and retain a skilled defense workforce capable of addressing a myriad \nof national security challenges in a highly complicated and technologically evolving global"

To do this, the Department is committed to providing a competitive compensation \npackage for those individuals willing to serve their country.  Recognizing the importance of the \nTF, the FY 2025 budget includes a 4.5 percent pay raise for  the military and a 2.0 percent pay \nraise for civilian personnel.  This commitment is built into the FY  2025 budget request and is \ndemonstrated by the number of initiatives and programs to support military and civilian members’ \nprofessional development and take care of them selves and their families.  This includes the \nDepartment's significant effort s to professionally educate its personnel to make them more \neffective at performing their duties and improve their ability to thrive throughout the life -cycle of \ntheir career.   \nThe Department is equally committed to strengthening its career skills programs to support \nmission readiness and the successful transition of military service members to civilian life through \nopportunities such as off -duty voluntary education, credentialing programs, registered \napprenticeships, and SkillBridge.  These programs ensure military service members can better \nplan their career development, build upon their skills, and receive credit that translates into their \nmilitary and post-military careers.  T he DoD is committed to validating these skills and abilities \nagainst external standards.  \n \nThe Department also remains dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of its personnel, which \nrequires an enduring culture of safety with overarching safety governance supported by regular \nand consistent reporting.  The FY  2025 budget includes resourcing  requirements based on the \n2020 National Commission on Military Aviation Safety to establish and implement uniform safety \ndata collection standards and processes for improved reporting and analysis in support of mishap \nprevention activities. \nEnsuring the participation of a diverse workforce also demands investments in attracting diverse \ntalents to meet our critical operational mission needs for the 21\nst century and  fill our most \ndemanding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) priorities.  Emphasis on \nexpanding partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Servicing \nInstitutions is focused on leveraging direct\n hiring authorities and internship opportunities with \nstudents and graduates from these institutions.  \nAdditionally, the D epartment support s recruiting by expanding marketing and advertising \ncapabilities by funding youth- focused joint marketing efforts to grow consideration for military \nservice among those who likely have never considered service.  The Department is also initiating \ntargeted campaigns towards influencers of underrepresented youth designed to garner support \nfrom key influencers to remove potential barriers for proposed youth and to foster consideration \nfor serving among the broader youth market. \nExpanding capacity and access to childcare also remain a top priority.  The FY 2025 budget \nrequest of $33.5 million supports childcare workforce initiatives to include redesigned childcare  \nprovider compensation, modernization of the childcare workforce, and the addition of special \nneeds inclusion coordinators.  FY 2025 is the first year of the Department’s multi-year plan.  The \nDepartment will invest $ 169 million to construct four child development centers. The Army will \ninvest in three child development centers (Fort Liberty, North Carolina; Fort Meade, Maryland; \nand Germany), and the Air Force will invest in one child development center (Mountain Home Air \nForce Base, Idaho). \n 4.5 percent military and 2.0 percent civilian pay raises – building on top of the \n10 percent increase implemented over the previous 2 years"

People are the Department’s most valuable asset, and these investments are \nnecessary to maintain our competitive advantage.  A  robust pay and benefits package must be \nsustained to ensure the best warfighters are available to defend the Nation.   \nMilitary pay and benefits funding grows by $ 3.0 billion over the FY  2024 request level.  This \nincrease includes funding for a 4.5 percent military pay raise, which builds on the 10 percent pay \nincrease implemented over the last 2 years and is critical to retaining the best of today’s force as \nwe create new opportunities for advancement that drive promotion and retention for tomorrow’s \nTotal Force.  The FY  2025 Total Force end strength decreases by 5,700 from the FY  2024 \nauthorized level but will increase by 5,051 from the currently projected FY 2024 levels.  This slight \nincrease accounts for the recruiting challenges the Department is currently experiencing.  The \nDepartment prioritizes various initiatives to address recruiting challenges, such as the annual \nbasic pay raise proposal.  The FY 2025 budget requests funding for a full range of compensation \nprograms, including monthly special and incentive pays.  Not only will the Department be using \nmonetary benefits for Service members, but it will also take on initiatives to expand the applicant \npool for recruits and improve marketing efforts incentivizing individuals to join the military. \nStrengthening Economic Security in the Force   \nEconomic security of Service members and military families is critical to mission readiness and a \npriority for the Secretary of Defense.  Military compensation must remain competitive with the \nprivate sector, and the FY 2025 budget request addresses the high stress and demands on the \nforce, the current labor market, and inflationary pressures.  Actions taken across the Department \ninclude but are not limited to,  increased basic allowances for housing and subsistence; \nadjustments to  the basic needs allowance program; increased access to healthy food on \ninstallations and throughout the commissary system; and improved availability of financial \nreadiness. \nThe Department is implementing solutions to aid those in need.  The budget includes funding for \nthe Secretary’s Taking Care of People Initiatives, specifically enhancing allowances to make \nmoves easier.  These enhancements will help to address the costs that can strain budgets and \ncause financial uncertainty during frequent moves.  Specifically, in the permanent change of \nstation (PCS) program, the Department has increased Dislocation Allowances for our most junior \nenlisted members (E -1s through E -6s) and s hifted the payment forward, ensuring Service \nmembers have access to funds one month before moving.  In addition, the standard time limitation \nfor Temporary Lodging Expenses has been increased by 40 percent, allowing Service members \nadditional time to transition between locations when moving.   \nThe Department is also reviewing overseas tour lengths and extending prescribed ones where \nfeasible.  In addition, the Department implemented the Basic Needs Allowance in January 2023\n. \nIt increased the eligibility threshold 6 months before being directed to in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act (NDAA) for FY  2023, in July 2023.  With the understanding that a military \nfamily’s economic security is essential not only to a Service member’s well-being but to command \n“Our people rise to every challenge.  And I am determined to do right by them, \nand their families.”  \n- Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin, Reagan National Defense Forum, December, 2023"

The Department created a web- based \nEconomic Security toolkit for commanders and service providers on Military OneSource to provide \nmilitary leaders with existing resources and flexibilities to address housing availability , financial \nwell-being, and food security. \nIn addition to the changes made to BNA  in FY 2023, t he FY 2025 b udget request includes \n$245 million to raise the income eligibility threshold for  the Basic Needs Allowance (BNA) from \n150 percent to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.  This proposal would help ensure \nthat servicemembers would not have to rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(SNAP). \nMilitary family economic well- being is crucial  to maintaining an all -volunteer force.  On \nJune 9, 2023, President Biden signed Executive Order (EO) 14100, Advancing Economic \nSecurity for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors, to ensure that the \nFederal Government is an employer of choice for military -connected families.  This EO directs \nExecutive Departments and agencies to strengthen their ability to recruit, hire, develop, promote, \nand retain this skilled and diverse talent pool.  This Government-wide Military-Connected Plan will \nmeasure success for the recruitment, hiring, and retention of military-connected families; enhance \nsupport for the retention of military spouses in Federal careers; develop legislative proposals to \neliminate barriers to the employment of military -connected families in the Federal workforce; \nmarket the talent, experience, and diversity of military -connected families to agencies; and \ndevelop a data -driven approach to increasing transparency and accountabili ty in hiring and \nretention. \nThe Department also works  across the Federal government to build collaborations and  identify \nunderlying issues.  The Department is participating in a Federal interagency policy sub-committee \nsponsored by the White House Joining Forces’ initiative to review and promote resources that \naddress food insecurity in the military.  Further analysis and data collection are ongoing to inform \nthe Department ’s efforts in this area, including a formal partnership with the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture and a separate qualitative study examining food access on and near \nmilitary installations.  The actions taken to date are not all-inclusive.  As the Department increases \nour knowledge of the underlying issues that undermine the economic security of the force, we will \nmodify our response accordingly. \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement \nThe Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) is a valuable youth development program \nemphasizing self -esteem, teamwork, and self -discipline in our secondary schools and \ncommunities nationwide.

As a part of the Department’s Total Force (TF) \nand critical enablers of our warfighters, DoD civilians serve various roles at locations around the \nUnited States, overseas, and around the globe.  Civilians perform functions such as intelligence, \nequipment maintenance, medical care, family support, base operating services, and other \nactivities directly supporting the military forces and the Department’s readiness.   \nWhile the DoD civilian workforce possesses capabilities, expertise, and skills that directly impact \nthe DoD’s operational warfighting capabilities, it is not immune to the current economic challenges \nof recruiting and retaining civilian employees.   The Department continues to improve recruiting \nand retention metrics by continuously reviewing, recommending, and leveraging the use of new \nand/or existing hiring flexibilities, professional development opportunities, and personnel \nincentives available.  This effort best positions the Department as  the employer of choice when \nrecruiting, retaining, rewarding, and developing the civilian workforce to support the warfighters \nwhile encouraging innovative best practices throughout the armed forces.  \nThe FY 2025 direct hire civilian pay and benefits budget increased by approximately $3.3 billion \nover the FY  2024 requested level.   The budget supports a 2.0 percent civilian pay raise  \n(2.9 percent annualized), which builds on the 10 percent pay increase experienced over the last \n2 years combined and will continue DoD’s efforts to acquire the most talented workforce and \nremain competitive.  Continued use of flexible hiring authorities, incentives, special pay rates, and \nworkforce development programs discussed above remain crucial to growing and ensuring \nworkforce readiness. \nOur investments in the civilian workforce focus on the importance of Federal employees as an \nelement of the Department’s TF, and the FY 2025 budget supports numerous efforts to advance \nand strengthen this critical talent. \n• The Department supports strengthening the national security workforce, consistent with the \nPresident’s National Security Memorandum (NSM-3), “Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy \nand National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships.”  The Department developed \nan agency action plan with specific actions to achieve NSM -3 goals, including to strengthen \ncivilian recruitment and retention and close critical skill gaps. \n• The Department continues to prioritize efforts to strengthen talent management by elevating \ngovernance and oversight to the Deputy Secretary of Defense level and developing a broader \nprogram framework to incorporate all aspects of talent management.  To further these efforts, \nthe Department appointed a DoD Chief Talent Management Officer (CTMO) to lead and \nimplement transformational changes in the development and execution of talent acquisition \nand management strategies.  Additionally, the CTMO continues to build talent teams at the \nEnterprise- and Component-level, and expand skills-based hiring through valid assessments \nthat measure the ability to perform the position's duties, rather than solely relying on the \ncandidate’s self-assessment and education.  \n• In FY  2024, the Department funded the DoD Workforce Incentive Fund (CWIF) with \n$20 million to attract and retain employees with specific and/or superior qualifications or \nskills.  The FY 2025 budget request includes continuing funding for the CWIF ($22.5 million), \nwith a portion of these resources allocated for student loan repayment incentives."

These programs provide an \navenue to bring in different perspectives and a continuous pipeline of diverse talent. \n• To address timeliness in recruitment and onboarding, the Department is collecting and \nanalyzing by-segment hiring data to identify and improve process bottlenecks.  The CTMO \nuses these results to develop enterprise-level hiring, insights, and behaviors, driving strategic \nprocess improvement and hiring and talent management efficiencies.  \n• Furthermore, the Department will continue establishing and expanding  work role coding to \ndefine needed critical talent beyond the traditional occupational series coding.  The DoD will \ncontinue focusing on areas of priority in the future, including digital, cyber, engineering, and \ntechnological sciences, along with others.   \n• Lastly, the Department invests additional resources to articulate and promote the DoD Civilian \nCareers employer brand to attract high- caliber talent in cyber, STEM, and all occupational \nareas where civilian employees drive mission success.  Every element of the TF brings unique \nstrengths to the Department, such as providing organic skills , expertise, and institutional \ncontinuity.  Effective and appropriate use of civilians allows the Department to focus its \nSoldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and Guardians on the tasks and functions that are \ngenuinely military essential—thereby enhancing our warfighters’ readiness and operational \ncapability.  There is no “one- size-fits-all” aspect to the TF.  The Department recognizes that \nconcerns have been raised over the size, composition, and costs of its civilian workforce and \nis committed to right-sizing and optimizing its TF utilizing the latest technological capabilities \n– to include military, civilians, and contracted support – to achieve mission effectiveness and \ndeliver warfighting capability and readiness. \nTo that end, the FY  2025 budget request takes prudent, well -reasoned actions to shape the \ncivilian workforce, maintaining a workforce that fully supports the National Defense, \nAdministration and Department priorities.  This includes continuously resourcing the cyber, digital, \nand innovation workforce by improving and accelerating recruiting, upskilling, reskilling, and  \nretaining tech- savvy civilian talent.   Additionally, there is an emphasis on efforts to train \nprofessionals on sexual harassment and assault and suicide prevention workforce, and \nexpanding diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives.   \nThe Department estimates the number of direct hire civilian Full -Time Equivalents (FTEs) \n(excluding Cemeteries and Foreign National Indirect Hires) will in crease slightly by 0.1 percent, \nfrom approximately 795,027 in FY  2024 to 79 5,432 in FY  2025.  Consistent with title 10 \nrequirements and annual appropriations guidance, the Department’s FY 2025 budget request for \ncivilians is predicated on requirements and workload.   Concurrently, and to better inform our \nfuture years defense program, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive review of not only \nof our civilian workforce, but also our TF, and doing so through the lens of requirements to ensure \nwe are consistently applying resources most effectively and efficiently to our most critical and \ncompelling needs related to readiness, warfighting capabilities, and meeting the pacing threats \nand imperatives of the NDS. As part of the review, the Department assesses how artificial \nintelligence, machine learning, additive manufacturing, autonomous and remotely operated \nplatforms, predictive analytics, big data, and other emerging technologies can help us achieve \nour mission while optimizing our workforce and resources.   Simultaneously, successful ly \nimplementing and operationalizing these technologies requires a highly skilled and motivated \nworkforce and the funding necessary  to acquire the new technologies based on cost -conscious \nfactual requirements and sound data to improve our ability to recruit, develop, and retain such a \nworkforce.

We continue \nmodernizing clinical and business  processes and streamlining internal operations to support \nhealthcare delivery in the direct care system. \nContinued Transformation of the MHS \nThe NDAAs for FY  2017, FY 2019, and FY 2020 contained language to drive various  structural \nand management reforms within the MHS.  Additionally, the MHS has faced numerous challenges \nand transformations in recent years.  Despite these obstacles, the MHS continued delivering \ncritical health services for the DoD, most dramatically on the battlefield and during the COVID-19 \npandemic.  As we come out of two decades of war and manage the dramatic changes COVID-19 \nwrought on global health, we recognize a strategi c imperative to rebuild our military and civilian \nmedical workforce and resource the MHS.  \nThe DoD leadership determined the most effective way to take care of our people, support the \nNational Defense Strategy, increase clinical readiness, mitigate risks to requirements, and reduce \nlong-term cost growth in private sector care is to reattract beneficiar ies to Military Treatment \nFacilities (MTFs) and maximize medical education and training pipelines.  Reattracting care to \nMTFs and Dental Treatment Facilities (DTFs) requires a stable, predictable workforce sufficiently \nstaffed, trained, and routinel y available to provide health care to our beneficiaries.   Rebuilding \nmedical capabilities and providing increased support to our clinical personnel is critical, but it will \ntake time and focused effort to accomplish while continuing to en sure necessary operational \nmedical support.  \nThe FY 2025 President’s Budget provides key resources for the MHS by focusing on improving \naccess to services for our patients by better integrating the direct and purchased care systems.  \nThis system will continuously improve, ensuring success in supporting Service members who are \nfit to fight; medical professionals who are ready to support them in training and on the battlefield, \nand provide outstanding outcomes for all those who serve. \nIn doing so, the MHS focuses on four key areas: \n1. Take Care of Our People.  Healthy, educated, and trained people take better care of \npeople.  We must restore the well -being of our health care personnel so that they are \nready to provide the best care and the best support for those who go into harm’s way.  \n2. Stabilize the MHS.  The realignment of medical personnel, a volatile health care economy, \nand a new electronic health record created challenges to care for our beneficiaries and \nimpacted our ability to generate and sustain medically ready and ready medical  forces \nefficiently. The MHS is self-correcting and recovering from these challenges quickly and \nwith purpose, driven by senior leadership. \n3. Modernize the MHS.  Health systems worldwide must transform to keep up with rapid \ninnovation.

The Information Management / \nInformation Technology (IM/IT) portfolio within the Defense Health Program provides the \ntransformational technology enablers critical to DHA’s modernization goals for the MHS.  The  \nFY 2025 budget request includes  $0.5 billion to support the continued modernization efforts of \nthe MHS, addressing the MHS Enterprise's aging infrastructure, degraded MTF operational IT \nsupport, and mounting technical debt. \nDigital Health Strategy  \nAs the MHS looks ahead to a new strategic and technological environment, we must aggressively \nharness new and emerging digital health technologies.  The surge in digital health care  across \nthe United States  and with our allies and partners  in response to the COVID -19 public health \nemergency provided valuable lessons on the accessibility of digital health, particularly its impact \non health outcomes, equity, and costs.  Many other potential benefits of a digital transformation \nin the MHS remain unknown or at least unexplored.  While digital health transformation represents \nparadigm-shifting opportunities for the MHS to reimagine health care, simply layering digital \ntechnologies on top of the current model will not lead to large- scale improvement.  Successfully \nimplementing a digital health transformation requires fundamentally rethinking health care \ndelivery day-to-day, operationally, and even in combat.  The FY 2025 budget lays the groundwork \nfor the digital transformation strategy informed by industry-leading practices, requirements, and \ninput from the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD), Joint Staff, Military Departments, and \nthe Defense Health Agency. \nStrengthening Military Families  \nThe Department, in alignment with major Administration and Secretary of Defense priorities such \nas “Taking Care of our People” and “Joining Forces – Strengthening America’s Military Families,”  \nwill keep faith with military members and their families by continuing to provide military family \nassistance through a robust Military Family Readiness System that includes child care, youth \ndevelopment and school liaisons, support for family members with special needs, relocation \nassistance, non -medical counseling, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR), spouse \nemployment, and military family support programs.   \nThe major initiatives to improve the quality -of-life of military members and their families are \ndesigned to mitigate the demands of military life.  Moreover, it reflects the DoD’s commitment to \ncontinue improving Service member wellness and delivery of prevention and response efforts \nwithin the broader context of integrated prevention, which targets factors contributing to multiple \nreadiness-detracting behaviors .  The Department continues to promote and support spouse \nemployment initiatives, including the noncompetitive military spouse employment program and \nmilitary spouse preference for relocating spouses of active-duty members. \nAdditionally, using the authority provided in section 625 of the FY  2022 NDAA to implement a \nDirect Hire Authority for military spouses at locations outside of the United States.  The Spouse \nEducation and Career Opportunities program supports spouse educational and career \ndevelopment, recognizing that spouses’ lives are disrupted w hen they relocate every few years \nwith their Service  member.  The Department also continued the Military Spouse Career \nAccelerator Pilot (MSCAP) to support spouse employment.  The MSCAP places military spouses \ninto 12-week, paid fellowships across the corporate landscape to transition from fellows to full-\ntime employees.  Military OneSource, a 24/7 information and assistance service, links military \nmembers and their families to resources and support and preemptively  provides nonmedical \ncounseling to address stressful situations .

These are just a few examples of the support network designed to ensure that \nmilitary members can confidently attend  to the larger Defense mission, as the Department \nrecognizes that family readiness is a key enabler to mission readiness. \n• The FY 2025 budget request includes $10.6 billion for military family support programs.  The \n$0.4 billion net increase from the FY  2024 request for military family support programs is \nprimarily driven by increased funding to expand non-medical counseling to support the Suicide \nPrevention and Response Independent Review Commission’s (SPRIRC) recommendations \naddressing stigma and other barriers to care.  A primary component of the Department’s vision \nfor childcare also includes an additional FY2025 budget request of $33.5 million to modernize \nthe childcare workforce.  Initiatives include redesigned childcare provider compensation, \nmodernization of the childcare workforce, and the addition of special needs inclusion \ncoordinators.  These actions will contribute to the availability of childcare for eligible sponsors, \ni.e., active duty military, active duty combat -related wounded warrior, child dev elopment \nprogram staff, DoD civilian, Coast Guard civilian, Gold Star spouse, DoD contractor, other \nFederal employees, deactivated guard/reserve personnel or inactive guard/reserve in a \ntraining status, military retiree, and other sponsor types based on an installation’s policy. \nFigure 4.3 summarizes of the Department’s FY  2025 budget request for these programs.   Key \nprograms are:   \n• Child Care and Youth Programs:  Includes funding for child development programs, which \nserve up to 180,000 children annually in both installation and community programs , and for \nyouth, teen, and school-liaison programs, which serve over 890,000 military-connected youth \nbetween the ages of 6 and 18.  \n• Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs:  Includes funding for mission-sustaining programs \nsuch as fitness centers, libraries, and single service member programs; voluntary education; \nand recreation programs such as outdoor recreation and auto skills centers.   \n• Warfighter and Family Services:  Includes funding for family support centers, and nonmedical \ncounseling support services for Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve members and their \nfamilies.   \n• Commissary:  Includes funding for the Defense Commissary Agency to operate  \n235 commissary stores on military installations worldwide, employing about 11,500 civilian \nemployees and offering at least 25  percent savings to authorized patrons compared to the \nlocal marketplace. \n• Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Schools:  Includes funding to support the \neducation of students in grades Pre-K through 12th.  \nFigure 4.3.

We \nare committed to ensuring that all DoD housing- whether government -owned, government -\nleased, or privatized-  meets life, health, and safety requirements , providing a positive living \nexperience for military personnel and their families. \nMilitary Housing Privatization \nUnder the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) legislation enacted in 1996, the \nDepartment has dramatically improved the quality of on- base housing in the U.S., addressing a \n$20 billion family housing maintenance backlog and achieving more than $32 billion in private \ndevelopment by leveraging about $4 billion in DoD contributions.  The Military Departments have \nprivatized 99 percent (approximately 202,000 units) of their U.S. family housing inventory, as well \nas 4,700 unaccompanied housing (UH) apartment units (8,500 bedspaces) on their U.S. \ninstallations.  \nThe Department has made significant progress implementing actions to enhance the MHPI \nprogram and oversight of the private sector MHPI companies who own, operate, and maintain \nMHPI housing projects.  For example, the MHPI Tenant Bill of Rights (BoR) is fully available at all \nbut three of DoD’s nearly 200 installations with MHPI housing, while the remaining three MHPI \nprojects committed to providing the Tenant BoR in full in 2024.  The Department is continuing the \nSmall Installation Privatization Initiative (SIPI) MHPI to address long- term housing requirements \nat small geographically dispersed installations  such as recent projects at U.S. Army Garrison \nMiami and Tobyhanna Army Depot.   In addition, the Department has implemented policies, \nguidance, and procedures to enhance oversight of the MHPI program, including quarterly \nprogrammatic reviews with each of the Military Departments, uniform housing standards and \ninspection requirements, and improved metrics to gauge performance by the MHPI companies.   \nThe Military Departments are taking measures to improve oversight and hold MHPI companies \naccountable, to include:  revising project business practices for corrective actions; working with \nMHPI companies to revise project performance incentive fee metrics and incorporate tenant \nsatisfaction survey results; establishing housing standards and inspection requirements; \nconducting housing inspections with increased frequency; increasing accessibility and \ntransparency of the maintenance and repair work order syst em; establishing policies and \nprocedures for health hazard assessments and mitigation; and refining internal controls and \noversight. \nIn keeping with the Department’s commitment to ensure a positive quality of life for service \nmembers and their families, the Department’s FY 2025 budget request prioritizes: 1) funding for \nthe Department’s oversight of the MHPI program/projects; and 2) investment to support the \nnecessary restructure of financially challenged MHPI projects to ensure that they can meet \nsustainment needs and deliver quality housing over the long-term. \nThe Department’s FY  2025 Family Housing budget request includes $194.0 million for \ninvestments in military family housing privatization and $171.1 million for the Department’s \ncontinued support of MHPI housing oversight and inspections.   \nGovernment-Owned and Government-Controlled Housing \nThe Department owns, operates, maintains or leases approximately 39,000 family housing (FH) \nunits, most of which are on enduring bases in overseas locations where privatized housing is \nunavailable.  In addition, the Department’s housing inventory includes approximately  \n850,000 government-owned and leased UH bed spaces worldwide."

The \nDepartment has begun placing greater priority on funding for its GovO/C housing, but the sheer \nsize of the existing inventory and historical accumulation of deferred maintenance challenges \nthese investments. \nTo overcome these challenges and improve the quality of DoD’s GovO/C housing, DoD must \naccelerate our investments and ensure they are appropriately prioritized to  have the greatest \nimpact on the livability of DoD housing.   As such, the Department has initiated a Tiger Team to \naddress on- going and urgent improvements in living spaces for Service members, initially \nprioritizing UH and FH for junior enlisted Service members.   The Tiger Team will address the \nNDAA for FY 2024 provisions and the issues highlighted by the GAO report.  Specific objectives \ninclude making immediate, ongoing, and urgent UH improvements; determining new configuration \nand habitability standards; improving accessibility, availability, and reliability of UH metrics to drive \ninvestment decisions; developing standardized preventative maintenance plans and schedules; \nand identifying opportunities to improve indoor environmental quality and address facility-related \nenergy resilience objectives in coordination with other DoD organizations. \nThe Department is committed to remaining focused and coordinated on its GovO/C housing with \nbi-weekly meetings at the Assistant Secretary level to monitor conditions and improvements and \nevaluate investment and progress.  At an installation level, the Department is improving its  day-\nto-day management with professional UH oversight by civilian employees or dedicated military \npersonnel, as directed in the NDAA for FY 2024.  This reform will enable UH managers to focus \nsolely on assessing and inspecting UH con ditions, managing work orders for repairs, \ncommunicating with residents regarding repairs, and ensuring that installation maintenance \nofficials conduct needed emergency and preventive maintenance. \nIn keeping with the Department’s commitment to provide healthy, functional, and resilient living \nquarters for Service members and their families, the Department’s FY  2025 budget request \nprioritizes investment in DoD’s GovO/C UH and FH to support mission requirements, address \nhealth and safety concerns, improve quality of life for of our junior personnel, and enhance DoD \noversight. \nThe Department’s FY 2025 $1.984 billion FH budget request is $43.1 million (2.2 percent) higher \nthan the FY  2024 budget request ($1.941  billion) and includes $549.9 million for 10 FH \nconstruction projects.  The Department’s FY 2025 Military Construction budget request includes \n$1.093 billion for 11 UH construction projects, which is $623.7 million (133 percent) higher than \nthe FY 2024 budget request ($469.3 million).   \nEnsure Accountable Leadership \nThe Department is committed to building a safe environment to serve. This includes fully \nembracing efforts to ensure the environment is free of any prohibited personnel practices and \nstrives to eliminate sexual harassment/assault, extremism, and discrimination.  \n  \n“We are one team, and we don’t have one single teammate to spare.

For that to happen, the DoD must ensure the mental and physical safety of all its members \nan eliminate sexual misconduct and other behaviors that destroy unit cohesion and overall military \nreadiness.   \nThe FY 2025 President’s Budget requests $1.2 billion for sexual assault prevention and response \nincluding $651 million to fund  the continued implementation of the recommendations of the \nIndependent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military (IRC-SAM).  Significant work \nis underway to staff, resource, and professionalize the response workforce to advance victim care \nand access to resources.  In addition, hiring is underway to build a full -time workforce of over \n2,500 dedicated prevention personnel.  More than 775 prevention workforce personnel are in \nplace, which includes approximately 175 prevention personnel in Air Force and Marine Corps who \nwere in place before the IRC-SAM and around 600 new hires.  Examples of other IRC-SAM efforts \ninclude seminal changes to the military justice paradigm, such as the successful stand up  of \nindependent Offices of Special Trial Counsels in each of the Services  to significantly strengthen \nthe independent prosecution of sexual assault  and enabling Service members who experience \nsexual harassment to access services from a sexual assault victim advocate.  The Department \nhas developed a Prevention Workforce Model, and prevention workforce policy, and has provided \ntraining and credentialing necessary to support the initial cohort of specialized prevention \npersonnel, with more than 350 receiving their credential in FY  2023.  These personnel are the \ncenterpiece to establishing a robust, integrated prevention system that defeats multiple harmful, \nreadiness detracting behaviors to include sexual assault and harassment, but also suicide, \nretaliation, domestic and child abuse, and other problematic behaviors.  \nSuicide Prevention and Response \nEvery death by suicide is a tragedy and weighs heavily on the military community.  The \nDepartment is steadfast in its commitment to suicide prevention and the overall well-being of our \nService members and their families.  While there has been meaningful pr ogress in some areas, \nthe rate of suicides in the military is still far too high.  Our evolving approach addresses suicide \nwithin the broader context of integrated prevention, which targets factors that contribute to multiple \nreadiness-detracting behaviors.  Current high-priority efforts include reducing stigma and barriers \nto seeking help (e.g., career and confidentiality concerns), increasing protective supports (such \nas lethal means safety), and ensuring program evaluation of suicide prevention programs is \nimplemented across the Department as well as advancing data surveillance and analysis.  \nThe FY 2025 budget requests $547 million including an increase of $261 million to implement the \nSuicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Commission’s (SPRIRC) \nrecommendations, as directed in the March 16, 2023, Secretary of Defense memo “Next Steps \non Suicide Prevention in the Military.” \nThe Department has taken unprecedented action to counter harmful behavior in all its forms, \nincluding suicide, which  deepened our understanding of effective prevention and intervention \nstrategies and resulted in a more comprehensive approach to ending harmful behavior. \nDoD’s commitment is to continue improving Service member wellness and delivering prevention \nand response efforts.  The full implementation of SPRIRC recommendations will occur across \nthese five lines of efforts: \n1. Foster a supportive environment to ensure a healthy, supportive, and fulfilling quality of \nlife for Service members."

These problematic \nbehaviors jeopardize combat readiness and mission accomplishment, weaken trust among \npersonnel, and erode cohesion.  Leaders at all levels are responsible for fostering a climate of \ndignity and respect that supports diversity, is  free from problematic behaviors, and does not \ntolerate retaliation or reprisal against those filing complaints.  Ultimately, recruiting and retaining \na force with diverse backgrounds, thoughts, experiences, expertise, and education enhances \nDoD’s global joint warfighter capabilities fundamental to all DoD activities.   The DoD has taken \nseveral actions to strengthen its anti-discrimination posture and advance a culture of dignity and \nrespect throughout the Department. Notably, the DoD expanded endeavors historically known as \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion to include a distinct focus on accessibility to highlight the \nimportance of an accessible workplace and further ensure equal opportunity for all.  It also \nconducted the inaugural Talent Management Innovation Challenge to capture the diversity of \nthought, experience, background, and capability offered by the total force and bring forth new \nideas on improving talent management and diversity across the Department.  To inform decisions \nregarding the Department’s strategies to  invest in its people and culture, central to mission \naccomplishment, and in how we shape and conduct operations we collected research and data \nfrom DoD, industry, and academia that demonstrates how leveraging the diverse strengths of the \nTotal Force contribute to mission success. \nThe FY 2025 President’s Budget request demonstrates the D epartment’s commitment to DEIA \nand includes $162 million for dedicated DEIA activities.  This funding across the Military \nDepartments, the OSD Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and the Defense Equal \nOpportunity Management Institute is investing in programs and initiatives aimed at furthering \nDEIA, and incorporating DEIA values, objectives, and considerations in how we do business and \nexecute our missions.  With the publication of the DEIA 2023-2027 Strategic Plan along with the \nDEIA Risk Report later this year, the Department will provide actions and priorities to advance \nDEIA – ensuring our entire workforce lives by fundamental values that bolster unit cohesion, fortify \nindividual and collective strengths, promote innovative solutions to complex challenges, and \nculminate in efficient mission execution.  These are principles that are critical to all four NDS \npriorities.  They are not simply about building a workforce; they are the cornerstone of the human \nelement of warfighting and national security.  Ensuring diversity of backgrounds, thoughts \nexperience, expertise, and education is c ritical to enhanced global joint warfighter capabilities \nfundamental to all DoD activities."

Led by the Deputy and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nthe Replicator initiative is DoD’s effort to accelerate the rapid f ielding of capabilities needed by \nwarfighters.  Replicator builds on multiple efforts to add urgency to defense innovation and avoid \nsystemic roadblocks. \n• Replicator will deliver capability to our warfighters at a speed and scale relevant to the \ncharacter and tempo of today’s fight.  Moreover, the Replicator Initiative is about a process, \ninstitutionalizing the leadership focus and whole- of-department engagement that yields \nacceleration and dismantling institutional barriers —to help deter major conflict and win if \nforced to fight. \n• The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), through its elevation as a direct report to the Secretary \nand role chair of the Deputy's Innovation Working Group, has been tasked to help lead this \ninitiative, and in coordination with the Military Departments, Combatant Commands, and other \ncomponents.  \n• The first iteration of Replicator (“Replicator -1”) is intended to scale all -domain, attritable \nautonomous systems (ADA2 systems), substantially enhancing our ability to counter the \nPRC’s military mass with the goal to deliver thousands of relatively low -cost systems by \nAugust 2025 to help the Department counter China’s military buildup.  Replicator-1, Tranche-\n1 capabilities and systems: (1) meet the operational need identified by combatant \ncommanders, (2) are at high technology readiness levels or can be ac celerated to achieve \nhigh readiness within the target time period, and (3) have pathways to scaled production.  \n“But the one advantage they can never blunt, steal, or copy, no matter how hard \nthey try — because it’s embedded in our people — is American ingenuity: our \nability to innovate, change the game, and in the military sphere, to imagine, \ncreate, and master the future character of warfare.” \n- Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H.

This role is consistent with responsibilities \noutlined in the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy \n(NBS) and supports the priorities of  the NDS, \nincluding preparing for the Joint Force to operate \nin biologically contaminated and contested \nenvironments.  The Biodefense Posture Review (BPR) assessed DoD’s capabilities relative to the \nthreat, and preparedness for a bio-incident to include pandemic response.   \nThe BPR proposed a prioritized approach balancing the need to understand, protect, and mitigate \nbiological threats for an integrated, layered defense to proactively and preemptively address bio-\nincidents that threaten the execution of national defense required capabilities.  To posture the \nDepartment for biodefense and pandemic preparedness, this budget largely maintains increases \nin FY 2024 for Department-wide efforts to enhance the Total Force’s capabilities, capacity, and \npreparedness to rapidly detect, characterize, and mitigate the effects of biological threats, whether \nnaturally occurring, by accident, or deliberate biological incidents.  The FY 2025 budget also adds \n$42 million to improve early warning of novel and emerging pathogens, including deliberately \nengineered ones.   \nThis budget delivers improved early warning through expanded bio- surveillance and analytic \ncapabilities, aligned with advancements in the COVID -19 response and through NBS \nimplementation efforts.  This includes funding to build and operationalize the bio-surveillance hub \nand portal, capabilities to support big data capture and transfer, and expanded surveillance, \nphysiological monitoring, and sequencing capabilities for early warning and rapid, accurate \ndecision-making.  This also bolsters the Department’s intelligence collection and analytic \ncapabilities to better detect emerging threats of potential operational significance or pandemic \npotential, including advancements in adversary biotechnology capabilities that may impact our \nNational Defense Strategy missions. \nThis budget funds improved preparedness to rapidly respond to biological threats and mitigate \ntheir effects, including a common operating picture to improve biodefense materiel readiness and \nmaterial management, expanded stocks of non-medical Personal Protective Equipment, so that \nthe Joint Force can continue operations and fight through a bio -incident, and increased training \nand exercises for biodefense preparedness and response.  The DoD invests in enhancing our \nindustrial base and optimizing the manufacturing of key countermeasures. \nThis budget builds on the research, development, and acquisition advancements enabled by  \nEnhanced Biodefense and Pandemic Preparedness investments in the Chemical and Biological \nDefense Program that began in FY 2023.  These investments posture the Department to support \ntimely bio-incident prevention, detection, assessment, response, and recovery under the National \nDefense Strategy and the National Biodefense Strategy."

The \nFY 2023 audit involved over 1,600 auditors, conducting nearly 700 site visits.  Figure 4.6 shows \nthe DoD -wide consolidated audit structure and the Components pursuing or sustaining \nstandalone audit opinions.  The financial statement audit and remediation effort is all -\nencompassing.  It acts as a catalyst to drive reform and innovation to best s upport the \nDepartment’s mission readiness and lethality, reinforces account ability to taxpayers, and \ngenerates detailed findings and recommendations to guide further corrective actions .  This \ncontinuing effort will result in greater transparency, enabling timely insights that support focused \nand sustainable solutions for the Department’s complex environment.  \nIn addition to the 27 standalone audits conduc ted in past years, the Independent Public \nAccounting (IPA) firms conducted two new standalone audits in FY  2023 for DARPA and the \nDefense Threat Reduction Agency.  The DoD  Office of Inspector General oversaw the work of \nthe IPAs and issued the overarching consolidated audit opinion.  In FY 2023, ten reporting entities \nreceived unmodified opinions and one received a qualified (modified) opinion.   Seven of these \nreporting entities had received unmodified opinions as of November 15, 2023, as reported in the \nFY 2023 Agency Financial Report.  The total increased to ten as three outstanding audits resulted \nin unmodified opinions.  In February 2024 the USMC received an unmodified audit opinion -  the \nfirst military service in DoD to do so. \nAll other DoD reporting entities and the DoD consolidated audit received a disclaimer of opinion.  \nA disclaimer of opinion means the auditor could not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence \non which to base an opinion on the financial statements; the auditor concludes that the possible \neffects on the financial statements of undetected misstatements, if any, could be both material \nand pervasive.  Despite the disclaimer of opinion, DoD continues progressing toward a favorable \naudit opinion.  Figure 4.6 shows each reporting entity's resulting opinion or disclaimer. \n  \n“We are working hard to address audit findings as well as recommendations \nfrom the Government Accountability Office.  The Components are making \ngood progress resulting in meaningful benefits...” \n- Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Michael J. McCord, November, 2023"

The Military Departments and each \nComponent under a standalone audit with a disclaimer of opinion will continue to maintain an \naudit roadmap.  These audit roadmaps align audit remediation strategies across the Department \nand facilitat e how each Component directs its audit resources.  The roadmaps guide the \nimplementation of corrective measures and establish milestones against which progress can be \nmeasured and the return on the Department’s audit investment can be assessed.  \nThe Department continues to monitor the number of notices of findings and recommendations \nclosed and material weaknesses downgraded to a significant deficiency or resolved, to measure \nprogress toward achieving a Department-wide unmodified opinion.   \nA significant deficiency is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal \ncontrol less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those \ncharged with governance.  As of January 18, 2024, the Department has closed 771 (25.6 percent) \nof its 3,008 FY 2022 audit findings.  The Department will continue using audit findings to drive \nand sustain remediation efforts, focusing on findings integral to resolving material weaknesses. \nAudit Benefits \nAs a direct result of the annual audit efforts, financial system and business process improvements \nare already resulting in taxpayer savings through gained efficiencies, more reliable data for \ndecision-making, and promoting public confidence.  Tools initially developed to support the \nfinancial statement audits, such as Advancing Analytics ( Advana), the Department’s enterprise-\nwide, multi-domain data, analytics, and AI platform, are expanding support to other areas of DoD \noperations.   \nReturn on investment is measured across five areas essential to the Department’s ability to \nachieve its audit, financial management, and National Defense Strategy goals:  \nWorkforce Modernization –  Increasing robotic process automation or “bot” adoption gives \npersonnel the tools to execute basic procedures in a fraction of the time it would take a person to \ncomplete the task, making time for other, more complex tasks available.  \nBusiness Operations – Strengthening the controls environment, enhancing visibility over physical \nassets, saving manpower hours, and optimizing resources as senior leaders and the workforce \nlearn to do more with less.  \nQuality Decision -Making – Improving information technology (IT) systems, enhancing data \ntimeliness and accuracy, and consolidating data to arm decision- makers with real -time, \nDepartment-wide views, and advanced data analytic capabilities.  Leaders use modern \ndashboards, metrics, and analytics to optimize the logistical posture and improve the warfighter’s \nreadiness. \nReliable Networks –  Testing physical and logical controls and providing direct and specific \nfeedback on where system owners must improve security and controls to help prevent hacks and \ncyberattacks, both foreign and domestic.  \nEnhanced Public Confidence –  Giving taxpayers improved accountability for the financial and \nphysical assets entrusted to the Department and increasing transparency into the use and \ncondition of those assets for greater confidence in the Department’s stewardship."

In July 2023 when Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Hicks directed offices of primary responsibility (OPRs)  to update current value and \ntargets of all Strategic Priority Metrics (SPM s) by the end of FY  2023, the CDAO formed the \nPrincipal Staff Assistants Analytic Project Teams (PSA -APTs) to focus Executive Performance \nproducts.  These PSA -APTs assisted in creating the Principal Staff Assistants  (PSAs) \nManagement Dashboard for OSD leadership  and targeted data engineering and analytics \nassistance to OPRs to use quality data across functional communities in support of Secretary of \nDefense priority areas.  By the end of September 2023, 105 of 119 priority metrics used data to \ncalculate a current value in the SPM Dashboard.  Now, the OPRs are increasing that number as \nthey re-baseline priority metrics for their annual reporting requirements in the new fiscal year. \n \nThe CDAO also collaborated with the USD(A&S) and Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) on \nmigration efforts to make \"gold-standard\" contract data available across the Department.  These \nnew data sets enable acquisition teams and procurement professionals to leverage contract data \nwith accuracy down to the cent for over $400 billion a year in DoD obligations.  This gold standard \nallows USD(A&S) to answer congressional for metrics such as Procurement Administrative Lead \n“The objectives of Pulse are to develop and integrate data-informed, outcome-\nbased metrics to show how DoD is performing; to enable SecDef/DepSecDef to \nproactively monitor that performance, and to ensure performance \nimprovement efforts across DoD are in alignment.” \n- Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H.

We have innovated and reformed in this area through \nthe Soldier Referral Program and the Future Soldier Prep Course, where we work tirelessly to \nimprove our recruiting and accessions process.  We streamlined the medical review process by \nsurging medical personnel to processing stations.   These efforts enabled the Army to end \nFY 2023 with 55,000 recruiting contracts, including 4,600 for the Delayed Entry Program.  \nTo develop that understanding, the Army established a study team to examine  the Army’s \nrecruiting challenges and practices.  This undertaking identified the symptoms, their root causes, \nand recommended solutions.  Based on the team’s excellent work and after discussion at senior \nlevels, the Army has made decisions that will transform the Army recruiting enterprise and position \nus to start building back our end strength.  We are changing who we recruit, how we recruit, and \nwho we recruit with. \nWe are going to broaden our prospect pool to \ninclude more of the available labor force.   We will \ntransition from a “borrowed” workforce model to a \npermanent specialized recruiter workforce. \nWe will elevate Recruiting Command to report \ndirectly to the Army's Secretary and Chief of Staff.  \nThe Commanding General will serve a four -year \ntenure to lead and deliver results.

We cannot rely simply on maintaining our seapower to fight and decisively win our \nNation’s wars – we must strengthen our maritime dominance.  Strengthening requires time under \ntension, challenging our shipbuilders, maintenance facilities, and the entire defense industrial \nbase to expand production.  Strengthening also requires enhancing our submarine capabilities, \nbuilding a climate-ready force, innovating and adapting new uncrewed technology, and increasing \nour undersea advantage by enhancing our trilateral security partnership called “AUKUS” - \nAustralia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \nBuilding a Culture of Warfighting Excellence.  Our people provide the foundational strength \nfor the DON and provide us competitive warfighting advantage over our competitors.  Building a \nculture of warfighting excellence is founded on strong leadership rooted in treating each other \nwith dignity and respect.  Taking care of our people is absolutely critical to our mission.  We will \ncontinue our efforts to improve quality of service for our Sailors, Marines, civilians, and their \nfamilies.  We will leverage our naval education opportunities to build and sustain a strong, diverse, \nand healthy force.  Imperative research, development, science, and technology enable us to \ninnovate at the speed of relevancy – ensuring our competitive edge over our adversaries. \nEnhancing our Strategic Partnerships.  We will work to continue enhancing strategic \npartnerships across the Joint Force, industry, academia, and with our allies and partners around \nthe globe.  Internally, we need to leverage those who make up our defense ecosystems, our \ncontractors, academia, and think tanks.  At the same time, we must use  a comprehensive, \nbipartisan engagement strategy focused on creative partnerships to overcome long- standing \nprocedural and structural impediments.   Externally, we will str engthen military -to-military \nrelationships with existing allies and partners. \nMaritime Statecraft.  In a broad sense, maritime statecraft encompasses naval diplomacy and a \nnational, whole-of-government effort to build comprehensive U.S. and allied maritime power, both \ncommercial and naval.  Our new maritime statecraft should be bold, founded on a strong Navy \nand Marine Corps to fulfill our national security interests.  It should also be equally strong on \nengagement in areas of economic development, trade, and climate diplomacy to enable us to \ncompete more successfully on a global ly.  It should leverage the tremendous advantages we \nuniquely enjoy in innovation and technology, particularly in the maritime domain.  It must be \nforward-looking to anticipate how to address future challenges that include competition over \nindustrialization of the oceans and how to re- define territorial waters and economic exclusive \nzones as sea levels rise.  A successful maritime statecraft would also advance cooperation on \nshared challenges in this era of intensifying inter -state competition.  History proves that, in the \nlong run, there has never been a great naval power that wasn’t also a maritime power — a \ncommercial shipbuilding and global shipping power.  There are steps we are taking and can take \nin the future as a nation to revitalize our maritime industry. \nTo protect maritime supremacy, we will continue to advance our enduring priorities, which are \npurpose-built to serve as an interconnected framework for ongoing evolution.  Guided by our \nmission and vision, and remaining committed to our priorities, we will continue to field the world’s \nmost dominate maritime force. \nThe DON is in contact with our adversaries daily on the sea, undersea, land, air, and  in space.  \nTo build our competitive advantage we are moving with urgency to make the necessary \ninvestments for the fleet and force our country needs today and into the future.

To meet these \nrequirements, the Marine Corps’ priorities for FY 2025 are:  \nBalance Crisis Response with Modernization Efforts : Accelerate and streamline \nmodernization efforts, so that Force Design is understood as the journey toward a ready force for \na peer fight.  This journey includes the best training, equipment, and people.  Simultaneously, an \nability to rapidly respond to crises is an essential capability that the Marine Corps will maintain. \nNaval Integration and Organic Mobility:  Partner and integrate with the Navy at every level \npossible to provide the Joint Force with sea based expeditionary forces that are task organized \nto deliver combat power from the littorals to points further inland.  The Marine Corps remains \nfocused on the statutory requirement of no fewer than 31 Amphibious Warfare Ships (10 LHA/D \nand 21 LPD), in concert with the Medium Landing Ship to provide the organic lift required to \nenable Fleet and Joint Force maneuver. \nQuality of Life:  Recruit and retain the best by improving our barracks, base housing, gyms, chow \nhalls, child development centers, and personnel policies .  Quality of life improvements directly \ncontribute to a more capable and lethal force. \nRecruit, Make, and Retain Marines:  Continue sending the very best to recruiting and instructor \nduty so our newest Marines benefit from the best role models very early in their careers as \nwarriors.  Reward those who choose to stay in the Marine Corps with quality retention options \nand incentives. \nMaximize the Potential of the Reserves:  Appropriately resource the Reserve Component to be \nready, responsive, and relevant to fight and win.  Marine Corps Forces Reserve possesses a \nwealth of expertise and esprit, and it will make it  easier for Marines to transition from active to \nreserve and back again.  There is only one kind of Marine, the fighting kind. \nSecurity and Operational Environment \nToday’s challenging security environment, from the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean \nand Northern Atlantic, to the Western Pacific, demands a fleet full of Sailors and Marines trained, \nplus properly armed and equipped, to respond to adversaries and opportunistic actors . The \nthreats to our Nation and our interest s are real and growing.  The strategic environment has \nchanged; gone are the days of operating from a maritime sanctuary against competitors who \ncannot threaten us.  The NDS makes clear that w e must defend our homeland, deter strategic \nattacks, deter and be prepared to prevail in conflict against the People’s Republic of China, and \nmeet the acute challenge of an aggressive Russia and other persistent threats.  Our adversaries \nhave designed thei r militaries to overcome our traditional sources of strength.  We must move \nrapidly to stay ahead and continuously create warfighting advantages.  We must think, act, and \noperate differently, leveraging wargaming and experimentation to integrate conventional \ncapability with hybrid, unmanned, and disruptive technologies.  Tomorrow’s battlefield will be \nincredibly challenging and complex.  \nOver the last year, we have seen our United States Navy at the center of global and national \nsecurity.  Although Navy ships have played a significant part in almost every conflict since the \nVietnam-era, not since the “Tanker Wars\" in the 1980's has our surface fleet been a daily news \nstory broadcast worldwide.  Over the last several months, our teammates around the world have \ndemonstrated that America's Warfighting Navy is as ready and relevant as ever."

FY 2025 Navy Total Budget Request by Appropriation ($ in billions) \n \nOperating under constrained budget caps in FY  2025 identified in the FRA hinders the \nDepartment in fully executing our strategic priorities, such as investing in cutting- edge \ntechnologies and capabilities.  Within the Department we made a conscious decision to protect \nour people and readiness, at the expense of reducing acquisition to live within budget constraints.  \nThis budget strategically allocates resources to our operations and readiness accounts to position \nthe Nation’s Naval Force forward in defense of our interests today, evidenced by the superb \nexecution by our forces in the Red Sea.    \nFigure 6.1 breaks out the $257.6 billion PB25 request by major appropriation group.  This budget \nrepresents only a $1. 8 billion or 0.7 percent increase over our FY  2024 President’s Budget \nrequest with minimal changes in all appropriation groups, except construction.  Our procurement \naccounts increase by 0.2 percent, operation and  maintenance increases 3. 6 percent, military \npersonnel increases 2.2 percent, research and development decreases 4.5 percent, and military \nconstruction and family housing accounts decrease 22.2 percent. \nAligned with Congressional intent, this budget request delivers the most ready and lethal Naval \nForces feasible under the FRA budget caps.  These caps, paced well below historical inflation \ntargets, force hard choices.  Due to the residual effects of infla tionary pressures of the past few \nyears, workforce challenges, and increased labor and supply costs across the defense enterprise, \ndrove costs associated with our shipbuilding account up roughly 20 percent over the last couple \nof years.  Hard choices were made, particularly in the procurement accounts.  An analytic review \nof production performance identified areas where we could take risk to comply with the \ncongressional fiscal caps.  We also adjusted the phasing of procurement of critical naval aviation \nforces to comply with the caps. \nThis budget fully funds the Nation’s top Defense acquisition priority – Columbia Class Nuclear \nBallistic Missile Submarine , prioritizes resources in the Navy shipbuilding account to fund the \nSubmarine Industrial Base, and includes the Marine Corps’ top priority, a LPD, while maintaining \n31 amphibious ships in accordance with the law.

The \nDepartment is ready to deter and prevail against today’s threats, however, to maintain our \nadvantage and improve our operational posture we must continue immediate and significant \ncapability modernization to keep pace with the growing military capabilities of the People’s \nRepublic of China  (PRC).  The Department will maintain readiness in the short -term while \ninvesting in long-term capabilities to manage growing risk over time. \nOperational Imperatives \nThe seven Operational Imperatives and three Cross -cutting Operational Enablers support the \nNDS and DoD’s priorities, create efficiencies through improved alignment, directly tie to budgetary \nrequests, and provide a focused set of goals the DAF must pursue to maintain our ownership of \nthe high ground. \n• Operational Imperative One:  Resilient Space Order of Battle and Architectures requires \nthe DAF build a resilient space order of the battle and architecture by integrating military, Ally, \npartner, interagency and commercial capabilities.  Achieving this will preserve freedom of \naction in space, protect the space-based services we provide to the Joint Force, and preclude \nour adversaries from being able to target the Joint Force from space.  This budget supports \nthis effort by increasing funding by $3.1  billion for Space Domain Awareness, Space Data \nNetwork, Missile Warning/Missile Tracking, and space control, essential to connect the joint \nforce in a highly contested environment. \n• Operational Imperative Two:  D evelop and migrate to a Command and Control (C2) \narchitecture capable of resilient, high-speed battle management of a distributed, adaptive \nforce and the operational ability to disaggregate execution when the threat requires it.   The \nDAF BATTLE NETWORK architecture will integrate numerous U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space \nForce programs by enabling distributed C2 at a variety of disaggregated locations as dictated \nby the operational situation.   The Advanced Battle Management System  (ABMS) is the \nprogram element that funds a subset of DAF BATTLE NETWORK capabilities, and will provide"

The DAF BATTLE NETWORK is the DAF contribution to Combined \nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2). \n• Operational Imperative Three:  Moving Target Engagement at Scale focuses on dynamic, \nreal-time long range kill chains technologies capable of engaging moving targets at scale in \nhighly contested environments.  In this budget, the Air Force is investing   \n$136.3 million and the Space Force is investing $740.3 million in developing and sustaining a \nfamily of survivable, long -range, and persistent sensors.  These sensing capabilities are \nunderpinned by increased investment in technologies necessary to complete, automate, and \nsustain long range kill chains.  These investment s will integrate complex external data, \noptimize sensor tasking, provide necessary battle management, and enable weapon- target \npairing necessary to close long range kill chains. \n• Operational Imperative Four:  Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of \nSystems directs the development of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) uncrewed \nsystems, autonomy development through the Viper Experimentation and Next -gen Ops \nModel, CCA crewed aircraft integration with existing platforms, and the continued standup of \nthe CCA Experimental Operational Unit.  Our investment of $674.8 million will allow our Air \nForce to deter aggression more effectively and maintain air superiority in the air domai n.  \nAccelerating CCA development will enable the Air Force to augment current and future \nplatforms with lower cost complementary systems that increase lethality and exchange ratios \nin highly contested environments. \n• Operational Imperative Five:  Optimized Resilient Forward Basing requires us to ensure \nour bases and airfields are resilient, sustainable, and networked to provide effective and \nreliable sortie generation and mission execution in a contested environment.  The Joint Force \ncannot successfully conduct operations at a rate needed to deter  aggression in the Pacific \nwithout optimized resilient forward basing that can remain functional and effective while under \nheavy attack.  Investment in infrastructure, agile co mmunications, and base defense are \ncritical to the success of this effort, this budget includes $600. 6 million to achieve this \nobjective. \n• Operational Imperative Six:  Long- Range Strike Family of Systems  directs the \ndevelopment and eventual employment of a long- range strike family of systems, integrating \nthe B-21 bomber with advanced communications, sensors, and a broad mix of weapons and \nsupporting systems to conduct long-range strike operations in a highly contested environment.   \n• Operational Imperative Seven:  Transition to Wartime Posture  focuses on posturing the \nDepartment to mobilize and transition to war and sustain operations in a contested \nenvironment, including supporting information technology systems.  The Air Force is investing \n$232.9 million, and the Space Force is investing $13.0  million in the modernization of our \ninformation technology infrastructure and platforms and improving cyber security and \nresilience. \n• Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations COE:  The DAF must achieve electromagnetic \ndominance to maintain the information advantage in highly contested environments.  \nAdvanced electromagnetic spectrum systems and infrastructure will enhance operational \neffectiveness, particularly Electromagnetic Warfare, Electromagnetic Spectrum -Enabled \nCyberspace Attack, and Electromagnetic Battle Management.  The Air Force is investing \n$50.0 million, and the Space Force is investing $150.0 million to accelerate these efforts.  \n• Munitions COE:  The DAF is responsible for investing in an affordable mix  of air-to-air and"

To this end, investment in capabilities that \nenable rapid test and production of new technologies with open system ar chitectures in \nrelevant quantities is necessary.  The Air Force is investing $210.6 million towards these \ncapabilities. \n• Mobility COE:   The Joint force must be able to effectively deploy, conduct, and sustain \noperations against peer competitors in highly contested environments.  A mix of survivable, \nconnected, and agile mobility platforms that reliably provide range, flexible payloads, and \nunique capabilities are necessary for sustaining operations in highly contested environments.  \nDue to fiscal limitations, the Air Force is not investing in Mobility COE capabilities in FY 2025 \nbut intends to continue capability assessments and seek future investments. \nTaking Care of Airmen and Guardians \nThe Department’s Airmen and Guardians within \nAir Force and Space Force create the decisive \nadvantage in our strategic competition and lead to \nthe success in our mission as part of the Joint \nForce.  We attract, develop, employ, engage, and \nretain our nation’s best talent to win the high- end \nfight.  The DAF remains committed to maximizing \nopportunities for all members, both military and \ncivilians, to serve to their fullest potential.   This \nbudget provides a $868.4 million increase to \nmilitary pay and incenti ves, so that all members \nhave economic and food security as they \nserve.  We also added $251.0  million to fund the civilian pay raise.   This budget provides \n$379.7 million for enterprise- wide Sexual Assault and Integrated Violence Prevention and \nResponse programs. Dedicated, talented, and selfless Airmen and Guardians enable our success \nand must be valued and supported. \nUnited States Air Force  \nAir Superiority  \nThe Air Force builds on previous modernization \ninvestments to attain a more lethal, resilient, \nsustainable, survivable, agile, and responsive \nforce.  These investments include multi -role air \nsuperiority capabilities and the capacity to defend \nthe homeland, project airpower globally, and \noperate as a joint, allied and partner force.  While \ncrewed fighters will remain the core of Air Force \ncombat power, CCA  will provide risk tolerant, \ncombat effective mass at an affordable cost.   The \nFuture Fighter Force is tied to the NGAD Family of \nSystems that will provide air superiority for the \nJoint Force in contested environments in the 2030s.  The Air Force preserves previous advances \nand invests across foundational accounts, while focusing resources on long- range kill chains \ncapabilities.  Our investments align with the NDS  to deliver warfighting solutions for the Joint \nWarfighting Concept."

The FY  2025 budget funds nuclear modernization \nand continues recapitalizing our contributions to the nation’s nuclear triad and Nuclear Command, \nControl and Communication (NC3).  The FY25 budget funds $4.6 billion for the Sentinel system \nthat replaces the +45-year Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.   \nThe nuclear-capable bomber force is the second leg of the Nation’s nuclear triad. Investments \nfocus on an expeditious transition to the B-21 and modernizing the B-52 fleet.  We also continue \nsustaining the B-1 and B-2 fleets to keep relevancy until divestitur e.  The FY 2025 budget adds \n$353M to support B-21 low-rate initial production to attain a nuclear-capable bomber force.  \nThe Air Force must build the right mix of hypersonic and long- range subsonic missiles.  The  \nFY 2025 budget invests in capabilities that can strike at long distances, including hypersonics by \ninvesting $727.3 million in the Long Range Stand Off /Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile and \n$825.5 million in Joint Air -to-Surface Standoff Missile extended range.  We aim to enable the \nindustrial base to manufacture hypersonic systems affordably and at the capacity necessary  to \nprovide a decisive advantage on the battlefield.  Similar to our previous request, the budget asks \nfor multiyear procurement to build inventory levels for  air dominance and precision attack \nmissions.  The Long- Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO) and Joint Air -to-Surface Standoff \nMissile-Extreme Range (JASSM -ER) must continue development and production to provide \nnuclear and conventional long range strike options. \nRapid Global Mobility  \nIn FY  2025, the tanker Total Aircraft Inventory \n(TAI) remains at 466.  Modernizing the aging \ntanker fleet is a priority in the Rapid Global Mobility \nportfolio.  The Air Force is investing $3.0 billion to \nrecapitalize the tanker enterprise, purchasing \n15 KC-46As to support air operations worldwide.  \nThe DAF maintains a tactical airlift C -130J/H TAI \nfleet of 271 aircraft .  Given the notable remaining \nservice life of the C -130H fleet, further \nrecapitalization of the C-130H is not needed.  The \nC-17A/C-5M aircraft TAI fleet remains at 274.  The \nbudget invests over $ 590.0 million in key safety, \nmodernization, and communication/connectivity modifications across the tactical and strategic \nairlift fleets in FY 2025. \nCommand and Control  \nA mix of space and airborne sensors is needed for Command and Control (C2) in the air domain \nto support Joint and coalition forces. Investments are critical to counter advanced and emerging \nair threats fielded or in development by adversaries.   \nIn support of modernization of our nuclear assets, the NC3 program is funded at $9 billion.  As \nthe Department modernizes the three legs of the nuclear triad, we must also modernize the \ncommunications systems and sensors that enable them to function; the Department of the Air \nForce provides 75 percent of the NC3 capabilities.  The NC3 is a component of JADC2 initiatives \nand must be developed in synchronization with other JADC2 efforts."

Our primary role is to serve as the combat \nreserve of the Army and Air Force and provide operational capability to the United States Space \nForce.  The National Guard provides trained and ready forces to support the Joint Force, and our \ncommunities in times of crisis.  National Guard Soldiers and Airmen are actively engaged in every \naspect of our National Defense Strategy (NDS) .  As 20 percent of the Joint Force, the National \nGuard is a significant component of integrated deterrence.  As the combat reserve of the Army \nand the Air Force - manned, trained, and equipped to fight our Nation’s wars, and currently serving \nin every Combatant Command - we play a key role in campaigning.  As a dual-status force that \nbuilds key partnerships at every level  - including international S tate partners, the F ederal \ninteragency, regional emergency management, and local law enforcement  - the National Guard \nprovides enduring advantages not found anywhere else in DoD.  The NDS cannot succeed \nwithout the National Guard. \nThe first NDS priority, homeland defense, is innately embedded in the National Guard through its \ncommunity-based force across the States, Territories, and the District of Columbia.  We perform \na myriad of critical missions including Aerospace Control Alert, homeland defense, cyber and \nspace operations providing 28 percent of all Department of the Air Force’ s unit-equipped space \noperations squadrons and disaster response at the request of State Governors.  The National \nGuard has over  4,000 cyberspace professionals supporting DoD cyber enterprise to mitigate \nmalicious cyber activity.  We stand ready to perform the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and \nNuclear response mission for the Nation and for the States.  The strength of the National Guard \nis our community -based model that embeds us in the very fabric of American society.  The \nNational Guard maintains partnerships at every level of government:  local, State, tribal, \nTerritorial, Federal, and international. \nThe National Guard’s support of the NDS extends to the second priority, deterring strategic \nattacks against our homeland, allies,  and partners.  This priority clearly demonstrates both the \ninterconnected nature of the threats and challenges we face and the cooperative approach we \nmust take to counter them.  Through the National Guard’s State Partnership Program’s (SPP)  \n88 partnerships with 100 nations around the globe, Soldiers and Airmen experience the global \noperating environment, develop military-to-military relationships, improve readiness, enhance \naccess and influence, and ensure our Nation has trusted, capable, interoperable allies  and \npartners at our side.  The SPP has proven to be one of the most valuable security cooperation"

As the NDS makes clear, mutually \nbeneficial alliances and partnerships are an enduring strength, and a key to the integrated \ndeterrence and campaigning efforts of the National Guard. \nThe third NDS priority is deterring aggression, while preparing to prevail in conflict when \nnecessary.  Here, perhaps, is the greatest National Guard transformation over the past 20 years.  \nThe National Guard has gone from a strategic reserve to an operational force due to focused \ninvestment in our people, readiness, and modernization.  The National Guard exists to fight and \nwin our Nation’s wars.  National Guard Soldiers and Airmen have served in over one  million \ndeployments since 9/11 and continue serving in every Combatant Command today.  T o remain \ninteroperable with the Joint Force, the recapitalization and modernization of the National Guard \ncontinues. \nAnd finally, the National Guard supports the fourth NDS priority through its contributions to \nbuilding a resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.  This priority speaks to both people and \nsystems - strengthening the resilience of the Soldiers and Airmen who serve, improving the \nresilience of the critical infrastructure on which we rely and enhance the resilience of our \norganization.  We continue to devote time and resources to improve all aspects of National Guard \nculture to make service more appealing and inclusive, to include fostering an environment that \nvalues education and understands the importance of mental and physical well -being.  We also \ncontinue efforts to enhance national resilience by protecting our N ation’s critical assets, \ncommunications and control, and infrastructure, and increasing our ability to withstand the effects \nof natural and man-made disasters. \nThe FY 2025 budget enhances service member resilience with cost-of-living increases, innovative \nchild-care opportunities for family members,  leveraging Integrated Primary Prevention, and \nadditional support services.  To address the current strategic environment and climatological \nrisks, the FY 2025 budget invests in our Nation’s critical infrastructure to protect against potential \nman-made and natural threats, and has embraced ‘green’ initiatives, where practical.  The \nNational Guard’s resilience is bolstered by close coordination with many diverse partners in and \nbeyond the State and Nation, our longstanding homeland defense capabilities, and geographically \ndispersed forces.  This benefits both the defense enterprise and the American people.  The Army \nNational Guard and the Air National Guard FY 2025 budget requests support the parent service’s \nstrategic initiatives and operational imperatives, which fully align to the NDS. \nArmy National Guard (ARNG) Budget Request \nThe FY  2025 ARNG budget request supports an end strength of 325,000, sustained from \nFY 2024.  To meet end strength goals, the ARNG remains focused on new recruiting and retention \ninitiatives to address the recruiting challenges .  The FY 2025 budget funds 4,087 full -time and \n585 part-time recruiters and fully invests in marketing and advertising strategies.  Additionally, the \nbudget funds ARNG statutory programs, and provides increases in Soldier basic pay, Basic \nHousing Allowance, and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. \nThe FY 2025 budget resources 27,311 Civilians and adds 40 full -time support personnel for the \nIntegrated Primary Prevention program, and 2  full-time support personnel for the Resiliency \nProgram.  This continues to enhance the Army’s Implementation of the Independent Review \nCommission’s recommendations to build resilient Soldiers and Families and enhance quality of \nlife.

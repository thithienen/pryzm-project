The Army is modernizing key capabilities, updating its doctrine, and realigning its organizational design in order to field a force capable of conducting Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) in one theater by 2028 and in multiple theaters by 2035. PEO Missiles and Space initiated organizational and workforce changes, by realigning our portfolio to provide a rapid and iterative approach to capability development that reduces cost, technological obsolescence, duplication effort, and acquisition risk. The realigned portfolio increases the speed of delivery, enables design tradeoffs in the requirements process, expands the role of Warfighters throughout the acquisitions process, and uses non-traditional suppliers. This approach – a major departure from previous practices and culture – allows for rapid response to changes in the operational environment and complicates competitors’ abilities to offset our systems. Moving forward, PEO Missiles and Space will continue to improve operations to better meet the needs of the nation and the objectives of the Army. This strategy details the path we will take and how we will prioritize our efforts to achieve our Vision and accomplish our Mission. \nMission: Develop, field, and sustain Defensive and Offensive Integrated Fires Capabilities in support of all phases of Joint- and All-Domain operating environments by 2030 and continuing beyond.Vision: PEO MS supports the Fires Enterprise with an aligned organization that is agile, versatile, efficient, and responsive, centered around an empowered and professional acquisition workforce. We remain an indispensable acquisition leader in streamlined processes and innovative solutions to deliver integrated offensive and defensive fires materiel solutions to the Warfighter and our allies/partners to defeat the threats. \nBG Frank Lozano United States Army Program Executive Office Missiles and Space"

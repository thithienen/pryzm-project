      "text": "Highlights of GAO-25-107569  \n \nA Report to Congressional Committees  June 2025 \nWeapon Systems Annual Assessment  \nDOD Leaders Should Ensure That Newer Programs Are Structured for \nSpeed and Innovation \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat GAO Found  \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) continues to struggle with delivering \ninnovative technologies quickly and within budget. Since its last annual \nassessment, GAO found:  \n• Program development delays and inflation, among other things, contributed \nto cost growth in the major defense acquisition program (MDAP) portfolio.  \n• Programs spent development time on efforts with low levels of maturity while \nusing the middle tier of acquisition (MTA) pathway intended for speed.   \n• Future major weapon acquisitions (newer efforts that have yet to begin on a \npathway) did not take full advantage of product development practices that \nlead to efficiencies.  \nProgram challenges and inflation drove major defense acquisition program \nportfolio costs. Combined total estimates increased by $49.3 billion for 30 \nMDAPs also included in last year’s report. The Air Force’s Sentinel missile \nprogram accounted for over $36 billion (73 percent) of this increase.  \nMajor Defense Acquisition Programs Continue to Delay Capability Deliveries \n \nDOD plans to invest $44.5 billion across 20 of its most expensive MTA \nprograms—intended to be completed in 2 to 5 years. Combined costs increased \nby about 3 percent for 14 programs we also assessed last year—despite one \nprogram reducing the number of units it intended to buy and another program \nending earlier than planned. \nFurther, schedule delays persisted. The expected time for MDAPs to provide \neven an initial capability increased this year by 18 months, up to almost 12 years \nfrom the program’s start—an average that includes MDAPs that began as MTAs. \nSeveral MDAPs reported delays to expected initial operational capability by more \nthan a year, while some MTA programs plan to deliver initial capability to the \nwarfighter multiple years after the current MTA programs end.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhy GAO Did This Study  \nDOD plans to invest nearly $2.4 \ntrillion to develop and acquire its \ncostliest weapon programs. But it \ncontinues to struggle with delivering \ntimely and effective solutions to the \nwarfighter. Weapon systems are \nmore complex and software-driven \nthan ever before. DOD implemented \nrecent reforms intended to lead to \nfaster results, but slow, linear \ndevelopment approaches persist.  \nThis report, GAO’s 23rd annual \nassessment, responds to a provision \nCongress included in statute for \nGAO to annually review selected \nDOD acquisition programs and \nefforts. It assesses the \ncharacteristics and performance of \n106 of DOD’s costliest weapon \nprograms.  \nIt further analyzes selected \nprograms’ implementation of leading \npractices for product development, \nas described in GAO-23-106222, \namong other objectives.  \nGAO identified programs for review \nbased on cost and acquisition \nstatus; collected program \ndocuments; used a questionnaire to \nobtain data from program offices; \nand interviewed DOD officials."

      "text": "Some programs used the MTA pathway to develop critical technologies. \nSome programs entered the MTA pathway—used for rapid prototyping and rapid \nfielding efforts—with low levels of technology maturity, resulting in lengthy \ndevelopment instead of the speed for which that pathway was designed. GAO \nalso reviewed seven former MTA programs with low levels of technology maturity \nat MTA initiation. GAO found that none were ready for production or fielding \nwhen the effort ended and will continue to monitor this issue.  \nFuture programs do not plan to fully use leading practices before initiation. \nOpportunities exist for future major weapon acquisitions that have yet to start on \nan adaptive acquisition pathway to leverage leading practices during the earliest \nstages of the program—before they become locked into rigid requirements, \nbudgets, and development approaches. These future programs reported that \nthey intended to incorporate leading practices generally at levels at or below the \nlevels reported by current MDAPs or MTAs. This is because decision-makers in \nDOD and across the military services do not take steps to ensure that future \nprograms include leading practices (discussed below). Incorporating leading \npractices prior to formally starting a new program can help programs take full \nadvantage of the efficiencies they provide. \nMost programs GAO reviewed do not fully implement leading practices in concert \nto achieve efficiencies. For example, most programs reported using a modular \nopen systems approach—generally required by statute—which allows them to \neasily add or replace weapon parts over time. Few, however, reported plans to \nestablish a minimum viable product (an initial set of capabilities that can be \niterated upon), use digital twinning (a virtual representation of a physical \nproduct), or use digital threads (real-time data to inform decision-making). These \npractices are most effective when they are used together as part of an iterative \napproach to product development. \nMost Programs GAO Reviewed Do Not Fully Implement Leading Practices, Including Future \nEfforts That Are Newer and Have Opportunities to Do So \n \nGAO made seven recommendations in March 2022 and December 2024 for \nDOD and military services to update acquisition policies and guidance to reflect \nleading practices that facilitate speed and innovation. DOD concurred with six \nrecommendations and partially concurred with one to the Army, stating that the \nArmy did not consider it fully applicable to a specific pathway. GAO maintains its \napplicability. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat GAO Recommends \nGAO is recommending that DOD \nleadership take steps to ensure that \nfuture major weapon acquisition \nprograms include leading practices for \nproduct development during the \nearliest stages of the programs. DOD \nconcurred with the recommendations. \n \n \n \n \n \nView GAO-25-107569. For more information, \ncontact Shelby S. Oakley at oakleys@gao.gov."

I am once again pleased to present \nour report this year, which is the 23rd annual report issued by GAO. The \nreport measures how effective these efforts are and highlights efficiencies \nthat could save taxpayer dollars on the nearly $2.4 trillion DOD expects to \nspend across its portfolio. It also provides DOD and congressional \nleadership with a decision-making tool through a “quick look” of each \nprogram’s performance and risk, as well as its developmental progress \nand use of leading practices. \nThe need for smart spending and increased urgency and innovation in \nDOD’s weapon system acquisitions are national imperatives. Our \ngovernment can no longer afford to invest billions of dollars to develop \nless than the most advanced technologies in an environment of mounting \nfederal debt and ascendent near-peer threats. The sophistication of new \ntechnologies—like biotechnology and microelectronics—and the rise of \nartificial intelligence and machine learning models have enabled our \nadversaries to seize upon rapid innovation and development to be used \nfor military gain. \nHowever, our findings over my 15 years have grown increasingly dire. \nDOD weapon systems continue to cost more and take even longer to \ndeliver, notwithstanding recent reforms. This year we found that one \nmajor defense acquisition program (MDAP)—the Air Force’s Sentinel \nintercontinental ballistic missile program—reported a $36 billion increase. \nFurther, the average expected time for MDAPs to provide the warfighter \nwith an initial capability increased by a year and a half, up to almost 12 \nyears from the program’s start. These delays put the warfighter at risk of \nreceiving weapon systems that do not deliver needed capabilities. This \naverage time frame increased despite the inclusion of MDAPs that began \non the middle tier of acquisition pathway—an acquisition approach \nintended to facilitate speed. \nDOD has made progress in some areas.

Further, delivering \nperformance “at the speed of relevance” is one of the overarching policies \ngoverning the defense acquisition system. DOD Directive 5000.01 also \nstates that the defense acquisition system will be designed to acquire \nproducts and services that satisfy user needs with measurable and timely \nimprovements to mission capability. \nTo deliver effective, suitable, survivable, sustainable, and affordable \nsolutions to the warfighter in a timely manner, DOD established the \nAdaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) in January 2020.

Our previous work—as well as other DOD and \nindustry studies—has found that user involvement is critical to successful \nsoftware development efforts because it helps programs to detect \ndeficiencies early.\n41 It is also linked to reducing risk, enhancing customer \ncommitment, and improving technical staff motivation.

GAO assessed 39 MDAPs, but cost information is available for only 36 of those programs because three new MDAPs have yet to provide official cost estimates. Costs for \nthree MDAP Increments that we assessed are also not included on this page. \n65Costs are reported in fiscal year 2025 dollars.\nNote: Some program costs increased or decreased due to changes in calculation assumptions about the effect of inflation. For example, one program stated it removed contingency costs for inflation after \ndetermining they were no longer necessary, while another program's inflation indices exceeded what was forecasted at contract award."

Program \nofficials for the Navy’s FFG 62—the program with the largest cost decrease—attributed \nthe decrease to accounting changes, not savings from efficiencies. Specifically, these \nofficials noted that the cost decrease is due, in part, to the Navy’s revised approach for \naccounting for inflation.

Ford \nNuclear Aircraft Carrier program \nreported unit cost increases of about \n$480 million (3 percent) since last year. \nChanges to CVN 79's delivery strategy \naccount for approximately half of this \nincrease but include funds the Navy had \npreviously planned and budgeted for \npost-delivery activities and are not new \nprogram costs. CVN 80 delays and cost \nincreases for CVN 81, 82, and 83, among \nother costs, account for the rest of the \nincrease, according to program officials.\nThe Navy’s T-AO 205 John Lewis Class \nFleet Replenishment Oiler program \nreported a cost increase of over $900 \nmillion, which it attributed to increased \noverhead, labor, and material costs. The \nprogram office stated that its budgets are \nbased on global forecasting, and those \nforecasts projected a steeper downturn \nin the economy than what occurred. The \nNavy also estimates T-AO 211 through 213 \nto experience cost growth due to current \ninflation indices exceeding what was \nforecasted at contract award. \nFigure 9: Reported 1-Year Cost

Six of \nthe Space Force's MTAs are satellite programs, which, as in prior years, account \nfor about half of MTA costs (see fig. 13).\nMTA costs include ongoing efforts only and do not include any further \ninvestments DOD may make to develop or acquire a capability after the \ncurrent MTA effort concludes. We previously reported that these costs can be \nsubstantial. As in past years, MTA programs reported inconsistent cost data \nfor some programs—complicating DOD's efforts to maintain oversight of MTA \nprograms' costs. In 2023, we recommended that the Secretaries of the Air Force, \nArmy, and Navy identify and implement additional actions to improve the \nreliability of MTA program data.\n67 The recommendations to the Secretaries of \nthe Army and Navy remain open as of March 2025.\nGAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment35\nPrograms with Notable Cost Estimate \nChanges since 2024 Assessment   \nThe  Air Force's E-7A Rapid Prototyping program \nreported an $884 million (33 percent) increase since \nour last report. Program officials attributed the \nincrease to higher-than-expected costs for updating \nhardware and software.\nT he Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation \nSystem’s (IVAS) rapid fielding effort reported a $169 \nmillion (11 percent) decrease since our last \nreport. The program continued to \nreduce its planned quantities \nsince our prior assessment—\nfrom 13,500 units to 10,000 \nunits. The program attributed \nlast year's quantity change to \nrefocusing on developing and \nfielding its full-rate production \nmodel, version 1.2. \nThe  Navy's Hypersonic Air Launched Offensive \nWeapon (HALO) program reported a $109 \nmillion (20 percent) cost decrease since our prior \nassessment. According to program officials, HALO's \nMTA costs decreased because the program planned \nto transition to the major capability acquisition \npathway earlier than originally planned. This does \nnot reflect a decrease in the expected costs for the \nentire HALO acquisition effort. HALO's transition \nplans are on hold due to budget concerns.\nFigure 12: Estimated Cost of 20 Current Middle Tier of Acquisition \nPrograms GAO Reviewed by Service (fiscal year 2025 dollars in billions)\nFigure 13: Estimated Cost of 20 Current Middle Tier of Acquisition Programs \nGAO Reviewed by Commodity (fiscal year 2025 dollars in millions)\nCOST\nDOD MTA Portfolio\nDOD plans to invest at least $44.5 billion \nacross 20 of its largest MTA programs. \nE-7A Rapid Prototyping\nSource: Boeing Defense, Mobility, Bombers, and Surveillance. | GAO-25-107569\n66The Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike was also included in our last report, but changes in its cost estimating \nmethodology prevented a cost comparison to last year.\n67GAO, Middle-Tier Defense Acquisitions: Rapid Prototyping and Fielding Requires Changes to Oversight and Development \nApproaches, GAO-23-105008 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 7, 2023).  \n/gid00002/gid00036/gid00045/gid00001/gid00007/gid00042/gid00045/gid00030/gid00032/gid00001\n/gid01175/gid01090/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid01176/gid01142/gid00001/gid01702/gid01094/gid01141/gid01087\n/gid00002/gid00045/gid00040/gid00052/gid00001\n/gid01175/gid01095/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid01176/gid01142/gid00001/gid01702/gid01088/gid01087/gid01141/gid01095\n/gid00015/gid00028/gid00049/gid00052/gid00001\n/gid01175/gid01089/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid01176/gid01142/gid00001/gid01702/gid01092/gid01141/gid01087\n/gid00020/gid00043/gid00028/gid00030/gid00032/gid00001/gid00007/gid00042/gid00045/gid00030/gid00032/gid00001\n/gid01175/gid01094/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid01176/gid01142/gid00001/gid01702/gid01089/gid01088/gid01141/gid01095\n/gid00021/gid00042/gid00047/gid00028/gid00039\n/gid01175/gid01089/gid01087/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid01176\n/gid01702/gid01091/gid01091/gid01141/gid01092\n/gid00004/gid01090/gid00010/gid01142/gid00001/gid00020/gid00032/gid00041/gid00046/gid00042/gid00045/gid01142/gid00001/gid00019/gid00028/gid00031/gid00028/gid00045\n/gid01702/gid01091/gid01142/gid01088/gid01087/gid01095\n/gid00008/gid00045/gid00042/gid00048/gid00041/gid00031/gid00001\n/gid00004/gid00042/gid00040/gid00029/gid00028/gid00047/gid01181/gid00023/gid00032/gid00035/gid00036/gid00030/gid00039/gid00032\n/gid01702/gid01090/gid01142/gid01091/gid01093/gid01089\n/gid00020/gid00028/gid00047/gid00032/gid00039/gid00039/gid00036/gid00047/gid00032\n/gid01702/gid01089/gid01087/gid01142/gid01089/gid01094/gid01092\n/gid00016/gid00047/gid00035/gid00032/gid00045/gid00001\n/gid01702/gid01089/gid01142/gid01096/gid01088/gid01094\n/gid00014/gid00036/gid00046/gid00046/gid00036/gid00039/gid00032/gid00046/gid00001/gid00028/gid00041/gid00031/gid00001\n/gid00014/gid00048/gid00041/gid00036/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00046\n/gid01702/gid01088/gid01090/gid01142/gid01094/gid01095/gid01092\nSource: GAO analysis of Department of Defense data.  |  GAO-25-107569\nSource: GAO analysis of Department of Defense data.  |  GAO-25-107569\n Source: U.S. Army.  |  GAO-25-107569"

In addition, \nthe Space Force's MGUE Increment 2 program changed its acquisition strategy in \nJanuary 2025 to transition to the software pathway at the end of the 5-year MTA rapid \nprototyping time frame. Vendors needed more than the 5-year timeline to deliver a \nprototype that meets requirements.\nOur prior work has shown that increasing even one technology readiness level \n(TRL) can take multiple years and becomes more challenging as the technology \napproaches maturity. We have also found that MTA programs that reach the end \nof their MTA effort and transition with immature technologies may risk additional \ncostly and time-intensive redesign work for the overall effort.

However, satellite technologies that have achieved a technology readiness level of 6 are assessed as fully \nmature due to the difficulty of demonstrating maturity in a realistic environment (space).

also reviewed MTA programs included in our prior weapon \nsystems assessments that have since completed their 5-year \nMTA efforts. We found that programs initiating with less \nmature technologies needed additional development before \nthey could move into production. Of note:\n•\nNone  of the seven programs that entered the MTA pathway with technologies \nas low as TRL 3, 4, or 5 transitioned to the production phase on the MCA \npathway or to a MTA rapid fielding effort to produce a fieldable capability.\n•\nOf\n the four programs that had no critical technologies, one transitioned into \ndevelopment, one into production, and one to the software pathway. The \nfourth program restructured into two MTA programs."

Last year, we found that rapid prototyping MTA programs that \ntransition to the MCA pathway at development start plan to take an average of  \n5 additional years before providing initial capability—for a total of 10 years on \naverage from MTA initiation. This year, more programs are planning to transition \nto the MCA pathway at production start, operations and sustainment, or to an MTA \nrapid fielding effort, shortening their overall planned time to capability. However, \nof the 15 programs that reported plans to achieve an initial capability, six programs \nstill plan to develop capabilities for multiple years after ending the current MTA \nefforts (see

responses.  |  GAO-25-107569\nNote: The planned time frame to achieve an initial capability begins at the date that funds were first obligated for XM30 and Conventional Prompt Strike, consistent with the Department of Defense's MTA policy \nfor programs designated before December 30, 2019. For all other programs, the planned time frame begins at the date when the decision authority signs an acquisition decision memorandum. We used the phrase \ninitial capability to refer to the envisioned initial operational capability, initial warfighting capability, or its equivalent, including any anticipated efforts on other pathways.\n70We asked MTA programs to provide the current estimated date for initial operational capability (IOC), initial warfighting capability, or equivalent. Five programs did not provide an expected date. For example, \nMGUE Inc 2 reported that there is an IOC date only for the broader system that it fits into. IVAS Rapid Prototyping does not expect to have a date until after its MTA transition briefing in the second quarter of fiscal \nyear 2025. Long Range Hypersonic Weapon and IVAS Rapid Fielding have yet to determine a date. One program did not provide an explanation.\n71GAO, Laser Communications: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between Development Phases, GAO-25-106838 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 26, 2025).\nWhether programs can achieve these plans remains to be seen. In practice, we have \nobserved MTA programs approach the end of their MTA effort only to postpone \ntransition to another pathway or require additional development. For example, the \nNavy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) and the Army’s XM30 Combat Vehicle  \neach delayed transition over the past year by 1 year and 1 quarter due to testing \nissues and contractor delays, respectively. As previously discussed, CPS  still must \nmature critical technologies.\nThe Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 and the Space Force's \nTranche 1 Tracking Layer (T1 TRK) have reported cumulative delays to their \noperational demonstrations—a key event to demonstrate capability—of 13 months and \n15 months, respectively. In addition, we found that Tranche 1 Transport Layer and T1 \nTRK may not provide the capability needed to maintain the constellation.71"

      "text": "42 GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment\nLegislation enacted over the past several years required DOD to change the way it buys and designs weapon systems by implementing a \nMOSA to the maximum extent practicable. 75 A MOSA, which includes a modular design and standard interfaces, allows programs to easily \nreplace components of a product. This approach allows the product to be upgraded with new, improved components that can be made by a \ngreater variety of suppliers and increase opportunities for competition.\nWe previously found that programs that reported implementing a MOSA did so with varying degrees of modularity and openness. 76 We found \nthat DOD’s approach to planning for, coordinating, and resourcing MOSAs, along with incomplete policies, guidance, and regulations, hinders it \nfrom fully realizing MOSA benefits. We made 14 recommendations to DOD, including that it improve military department processes for ensuring \nquality MOSA planning documents. While DOD agreed, these recommendations remain open as of March 2025.  \nNotes: The total number of programs may vary across practices but within the same program type (MDAP, MTA, future), because some programs were not assessed against all practices. For example, testing a system-level \nintegrated physical prototype in an operational environment was deemed not applicable for certain programs due to the difficulty of conducting tests in the operational environment—space. \n75In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA), Congress mandated that all major defense acquisition programs entering technology development or system development—milestones  \nA or B, respectively—after January 1, 2019, implement MOSA to the maximum extent practicable. The William M. (Mac) Thornberry NDAA for Fiscal Year 2021 expanded this requirement mandating that all other \nacquisition programs also implement MOSA to the maximum extent practicable.\n76GAO, Weapon Systems Acquisition: DOD Needs Better Planning to Attain Benefits of Modular Open Systems, GAO-25-106931 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 22, 2025).\nWe found that most programs expect to use a modular open systems approach \n(MOSA) (see fig. 21). Our prior work found that leading companies gain efficiencies \nand flexibilities through modularity in both design and manufacturing, and collect \nfeedback to continue improving products in subsequent iterations. However, these \nsame programs are not consistently utilizing the other leading practices that could \nhelp maximize the effectiveness of a MOSA. These practices include establishing digital \ntwins (a virtual representation of a physical product) to help to ensure different systems \nand subsystems work together effectively; prototyping and testing new technologies \nin a virtual environment before physical implementation; and planning to develop an \nMVP followed by subsequent iterations of capability. We found that these practices are \nmost effective when they are used together as part of an iterative approach.\nPrograms report incorporating a MOSA \nbut are not leveraging other leading \npractices to maximize outcomes.\nUSE OF LEADING \nPRACTICES\nFigure 21: Most Programs Are Not Leveraging Other Leading Practices to Maximize a Modular Open Systems

      "text": "Twenty-two MDAPs that have yet to enter production are not widely using leading \npractices that could enable the delivery of capability with speed. While many of these \nprograms expect to incorporate a MOSA, no more than half are using any of the other \npractices employed by leading companies, limiting the weapon system’s ability to \nevolve to future threats if needed (see fig. 22). Even though the MDAPs we reviewed \ncited constraints because they have already initiated development, we found that the \nadoption of these tools and methods can still help optimize production and ensure that \nthe capability will work as intended in an operational environment to meet user needs.\n43 GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment\nMDAPs in development reported  \nlimited use of leading practices.\nMDAPs\nFigure 22: Extent to Which Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) Are Implementing Leading Practices for Product Development\nOf the 17 programs not planning to develop an MVP, 11 reported adhering to highly \ndetailed system requirements to meet a specific materiel solution—reflecting the \nlinear approach that the Department of Defense has long followed. In contrast, \nour prior work found that leading companies progressively refine a high-level need \nstatement or idea into distinct requirements.\n•\nThe\n Army’s Improved Turbine Engine Program reported it does not plan to \nhave an MVP because it will deliver the full required capability upon delivery \nof the first engines to the warfighter. \n•\n The\n Air Force’s VC-25B Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program \nreported it has a detailed requirement and its end user expects full \nfunctionality at initial operational capability.\nJust under half of the programs (10 of 22) have at least documented a plan \nto develop a digital thread—a common source of information that connects \nstakeholders with real-time data across the product life cycle. Far fewer programs \nplan to use digital twinning, which leading companies use to, among other things, \ntest and validate a product’s design with greater efficiency.\n•\nThe\n Air Force’s B-52 Radar Modernization Program (B-52 RMP) stated it \nhad neither a requirement nor funding for a digital twin or digital thread, \nwhile the T-7A Red Hawk program stated that it had a fixed-price contract \nand the data required for these tools would be considered a scope increase.\n•\n The\n Space Force’s Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared \nGeosynchronous Earth Orbit Satellites (Next Gen OPIR GEO) program \nreported that digital twins were previously dropped from its baseline due to \nschedule and cost considerations.\nThe low prevalence of digital twins and digital threads among MDAPs meant few \nprograms would be validating hardware and software in conjunction with these \ndigital tools. \nOver half of the programs still plan to test physical prototypes in an operational \nenvironment—in line with our long-standing knowledge-based best practices.\n•\nThe\n Army’s Future Long Range Assault Aircraft and Precision Strike \nMissile (PrSM) programs expect to follow each of these system-level \nprototyping practices. \nSystems with modular designs and open interfaces are better positioned to accept \nupgrades rapidly and affordably as part of future iterations. However,  \nfew programs are developing MVPs and planning subsequent iterations.\n•\n The\n PrSM program’s acquisition strategy expects its MOSA will enable the \nprogram to perform continuous

      "text": "44 GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment\nTen of the 17 MDAPs in production (59 percent) reported assessing the defense \nindustrial base to identify potential manufacturing capacity and capability risks \n(see fig. 23). The defense industrial base includes companies that develop and \nmanufacture weapon systems, such as contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers \nof parts, components, and raw materials. Assessing related risks is consistent with \nleading practices. This number is up slightly from our 2022 report, which found that \n15 of 28 MDAPs (54 percent) either completed or were scheduled to complete such \nan assessment. In 2022, we also recommended that, among other things, DOD \nreport its progress toward mitigating industrial base risks.\n77 DOD concurred with this \nrecommendation and identified actions that it plans to take through July 2026.\nHowever, only five of 17 programs reported incorporating feedback from both \nmanufacturers and suppliers prior to moving into production, an approach \nthat leading companies take to ensure that the product under development is \nmanufacturable (see fig. 24).\nMore MDAPs could  \nbetter integrate industrial base \ninformation prior to production.\nMDAPs IN  \nPRODUCTION\nFigure 23: Most Major Defense Acquisition Programs Currently \nin Production Completed an Industrial Base Assessment\nFigure 24: Few Major Defense Acquisition Programs Reported \nIncorporating Feedback from Both Manufacturers and Suppliers \nPrior to Production\nSource: GAO analysis of programs’ questionnaire responses.  |  GAO-25-107569Source: GAO analysis of programs’ questionnaire responses.  |  GAO-25-107569\nLeading companies start production planning while they are still designing the MVP. Leading companies’ product design teams include \nthose designing the product as well as stakeholders producing it after testing and validation. Manufacturer and supplier stakeholders are \ninvolved throughout product design to ensure the manufacturing process can accommodate the design of the product. This includes \nanalysis of the industrial base. \nIt is generally DOD’s practice to delegate risk mitigation activities to the lowest level possible—the program offices—as these offices are the \nmost knowledgeable about the changing risks and must address them to help meet cost, schedule, and performance goals. Program offices are \ninstructed by policy to incorporate industrial base analyses into their acquisition planning.\n78 We will continue to monitor programs' industrial base \nassessments and associated efforts to incorporate manufacturer and supplier feedback throughout development and prior to production. \n/gid01094/gid01088/gid01727\n/gid01088/gid01089/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01089/gid01096/gid01727/gid00001\n/gid01092/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid00007/gid00032/gid00032/gid00031/gid00029/gid00028/gid00030/gid00038/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00045/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00028 /gid00032/gid00031/gid00007/gid00032/gid00032/gid00031/gid00029/gid00028/gid00030/gid00038/gid00001/gid00041/gid00042/gid00047/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00045/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00028 /gid00032/gid00031\n/gid00021/gid00042/gid00047/gid00028/gid00039/gid00001\n/gid00017/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01088/gid01094\n/gid01091/gid01088/gid01727\n/gid01094/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01092/gid01096/gid01727/gid00001\n/gid01088/gid01087/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid00002/gid00046/gid00046/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047/gid00032/gid00002/gid00046/gid00046/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00041/gid00042/gid00047/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047/gid00032\n/gid00021/gid00042/gid00047/gid00028/gid00039/gid00001\n/gid00017/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01088/gid01094\n/gid01091/gid01088/gid01727\n/gid01094/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01092/gid01096/gid01727/gid00001\n/gid01088/gid01087/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046/gid00002/gid00046/gid00046/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047/gid00032/gid00002/gid00046/gid00046/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00041/gid00042/gid00047/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047/gid00032\n/gid00021/gid00042/gid00047/gid00028/gid00039/gid00001\n/gid00017/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01088/gid01094 /gid01094/gid01088/gid01727\n/gid01088/gid01089/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01089/gid01096/gid01727/gid00001\n/gid01092/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid00007/gid00032/gid00032/gid00031/gid00029/gid00028/gid00030/gid00038/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00045/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00028/gid00047/gid00032/gid00031/gid00007/gid00032/gid00032/gid00031/gid00029/gid00028/gid00030/gid00038/gid00001/gid00041/gid00042/gid00047/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00045/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00028/gid00047/gid00032/gid00031\n/gid00021/gid00042/gid00047/gid00028/gid00039/gid00001\n/gid00017/gid00045/gid00042/gid00034/gid00045/gid00028/gid00040/gid00046\n/gid01088/gid01094\nSmall Diameter Bomb Increment II \nSource: © 2009 Raytheon Company. | GAO-25-107569\nThe Air Force’s Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (left) program has  \nexperienced production delays related to obsolescence and part shortages.  \nThe program conducted an industrial base assessment in 2013 but did not involve \nmanufacturer and supplier feedback throughout product design to begin planning \nfor production. This early planning could have reduced the risk that manufacturing \nissues would delay delivery. The program has taken steps, such as identifying \nadditional suppliers, to make up delivery time and minimize further delays and \nexpects to resolve these challenges by the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nSimilarly, the Navy’s Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile—Extended Range \nmissile program has experienced significant delays due to rocket motor, structural, \nand software issues discovered during testing, delaying a full-rate production \ndecision by 10 months. Program officials also attributed production delays to supply \nchain challenges and construction delays on a new facility. The program did not \nconduct an industrial base assessment or incorporate feedback from manufacturers \nor suppliers prior to entering production.\n77GAO, Defense Industrial Base: DOD Should Take Actions to Strengthen Its Risk Mitigation Approach, GAO-22-104154 (Washington, D.C.: July 7, 2022).\n78Department of Defense, Major Capability Acquisition, DOD Instruction 5000.85 (Aug. 6, 2020) (incorporating change 1, Nov. 4, 2021).\nLeading Practices for \nProduct Development"

Most \nMTA programs (15 of 20) reported working to refine or have already refined high-level \noperational needs into an MVP. Over half of MTA programs (12 of 20) plan to or are \nincorporating a MOSA. However, these programs do not currently plan to adopt the \ndigital engineering tools that facilitate efficiencies to the same extent (see fig. 25). \nPrograms cited obstacles to adopting digital engineering tools and implementing \nleading practices more broadly—in part due to limited staffing, budget constraints, \nand contractual issues, as well as other decisions made prior to program initiation. \nWe previously found that using digital tools such as digital twins and digital threads \nprovides real-time data to inform decision-making throughout the product life \ncycle; increases efficiencies throughout development and production; and helps to \nmaximize the effectiveness of a modular approach.\nMTA programs are not \nconsistently implementing digital \nengineering practices.\nMTAs\nFigure 25: Extent to Which Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) Programs Are Implementing Leading Practices for Product Development\nFifteen of 20 MTA programs reported developing an MVP. One program cited fixed \nrequirements as a challenge to doing so.\n•\nThe\n Space Force’s Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution \n(FORGE) reported that it delivered the minimum viable product and that \nit continues to develop subsequent releases as it plans its transition to the \nsoftware pathway in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. \n•\nThe\n Army’s Maneuver Short Range Air Defense Increment 3 \n(M-SHORAD Inc 3) program stated that, as a missile program, it could not \ndevelop an MVP because all functions are critical to meeting requirements.\nThree programs—the Navy’s Hypersonic Air-Launched Offensive Anti-Surface \nWarfare Weapon System and the Space Force’s FORGE and Resilient MW/\nMT MEO—reported initiating development of a digital twin. Other programs \ncited multiple challenges to using these tools, including financial, staffing, and \ncontractual issues.\n•\nThe\n Air Force’s Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile program, and the \nArmy’s M-SHORAD Inc 3 and Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon programs \ncited limited resources, including financial or staffing constraints.\n•\nT\nwo programs reported challenges with contractors, such as contractors’\nreluctance to move to digital tools or issues obtaining data rights. \nOnly two MTA programs reported testing or plans to test fully digital prototypes in \na digital environment. Two additional MTA programs reported having plans to test \nphysical prototypes connected to digital twins or threads but have yet to do so.\n•\nThe\n Space Force's FORGE program reported that it tested an integrated, \nfully digital prototype in a digital environment with replicated operational \nhardware, infrastructure, and platforms in 2024.\n•\nSe\nventeen programs reported plans to test a physical prototype in an\noperational environment—in line with our long-standing knowledge-\nbased best practices. \nOver half of MTA programs in our portfolio have implemented MOSA or  \nare in the process of doing so. \n•\n Some\n MTAs that are not incorporating a MOSA reported that the system \nis designed to interface with other weapon systems (such as the Space \nForce’s Military GPS User Equipment Increment 2) or have specific \nexisting interfaces (such as the Air Force’s F-22 Sensor Enhancements). \n0 5 10 15 20\n/gid01092

The program is missing \nopportunities to refine requirements based on feedback from users \nand stakeholders into subsequent iterations of capability.  Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 \nThe Army’s Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 MTA \nprogram is not implementing leading practices.

decisions, to fix \nvulnerabilities more easily, and to reduce risk to schedule.\n84 In 2023, we released a \nrestricted report that made recommendations related to early cybersecurity testing \nfor

      "text": "P\nage 50 GAO-25-107569 Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \nFor decades, DOD has fallen short in consistently delivering capability to \nthe warfighter on time and within budget—wasting billions of taxpayer \ndollars and often running years over schedule. In recent years, it is \nincreasingly struggling to keep pace with technologically advanced \nadversaries, including China and Russia. Yet, DOD can take immediate \naction to begin to fix these urgent problems. \nOne root cause of DOD’s consistent cost and schedule overruns is its \npersistent slow, linear development approaches. The department and \nCongress alike have acknowledged in recent years the limits of DOD’s \nexisting acquisition system. Our recent work on leading practices for \nproduct development identifies a structural approach and associated \npractices that facilitate delivering complex systems with speed. This \nincludes using commercial design concepts—such as digital twinning—to \nenable rapid iterative cycles of design, development, and delivery. \nFuture weapon system programs that have yet to enter a formal pathway \nhave an opportunity to take a different path from legacy acquisition \nprograms—which are largely constrained by rigid requirements and \narchaic development approaches. But these programs are not fully using \nleading practices for product development early enough in the acquisition \nprocess. The decision authorities who ultimately approve these programs \nfor initiation and weigh in during the earliest junctures can help structure \nthem to deliver capability with speed. Without doing so, programs may \ncontinue to fall short of their goals with systems that arrive later and more \nexpensive than originally expected. \nAs DOD moves forward with new multibillion-dollar ventures in pursuit of \nmore advanced capabilities, the significance of starting with an acquisition \nstructure that allows for iterative solutions to keep pace with evolving \nwarfighter needs cannot be overstated. DOD can implement early \napproaches that facilitate iteration—like starting with high-level capability \nneeds, planning for digital twins and threads, and using modular open \nsystems approaches—that provide a logical starting point for achieving \nbetter, more consistent outcomes. \nWe are making a total of four recommendations, including one to the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; one to the \nSecretary of the Air Force; one to the Secretary of the Army; and one to \nthe Secretary of the Navy. Specifically: \nThe Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment should \nensure that it takes steps as the defense acquisition executive during the \nConclusions \nRecommendations for \nExecutive Action"

According to the program, delays stem from \nongoing engine inlet issues the program found during design \ntesting and from Boeing’s lag in submitting proposals needed \nfor maturing the program’s cost and schedule baselines. \nOfficials stated that Boeing submitted qualified proposals in \nsummer 2024 that the program is currently reviewing. \nAs part of ongoing design work, officials identified a critical \nissue regarding engine inlet distortion—a non-uniform flow of \nair that can affect the engine’s performance and operability—\nresulting in a redesign of the engine inlet. While the program \nused a digital model during the rapid prototyping effort that \nsimulated how prospective contractors’ engines would fit in \nthe aircraft, officials said performance data from testing \nshowed that the design did not meet requirements. Officials \nstated that Boeing will complete wind tunnel testing to fully \nverify the design in summer 2025. Officials stated that these \ndata are essential to completing the critical design review, \nplanned for April 2026, 3 years later than originally planned. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program implemented some digital engineering and \nvirtual prototyping practices during its rapid prototyping \neffort. But, officials stated that the current effort is not fully \nimplementing leading practices because it is a sustainment \neffort affecting a legacy platform. However, our prior work on \nleading practices found that leading companies apply these \npractices throughout a product’s life cycle. \nThe program is currently using some digital models, including \naviation performance, system, and computational fluid \ndynamics models to support design decisions and develop the \nengine modification. These models are not digital twins that \nincorporate real-time performance data that would allow the \nprogram to take full advantage of digital engineering \nefficiencies, like the ability to optimize manufacturing \nefficiencies and reduce costs. Officials said that it can be \ndifficult to incorporate digital engineering practices on legacy \nsystems. They plan to use a digital thread in testing to serve \nas the single source of information for B-52 data and make it \naccessible to external stakeholders. However, this digital \nthread will not provide decision-makers with real-time data \nprovided by automatic updates from a digital twin. \nThe program is leveraging an open systems architecture \nwhere possible, including standard interface protocols, but \nmost new components are modified commercial items that \ncannot be modularized, according to officials. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nSoftware coding began in November 2022. Officials reported \nthat software deliveries are expected every 7 to 9 months \nafter the first delivery in March 2025—6 months later than \npreviously reported. The first software delivery will be a \nsystem simulation software suite to be used in the \ndevelopment systems integration laboratory. Officials stated \nthat end users—aircrew and ground support personnel—will \nprovide feedback on subsequent software deliveries. \nThe program’s cybersecurity strategy was approved in July \n2023, and the program reported a successful cybersecurity \ntabletop exercise in April 2024. The next cybersecurity \nassessment is planned for February 2026. However, the \nprogram plans to conduct a key adversarial cybersecurity test \nafter the start of production. DOD guidance recommends this \ntesting to occur earlier. Late testing makes it much more \ndifficult to fix system vulnerabilities due to lack of time and \nfunding before fielding or deployment. \nOther Program Issues \nAs previously reported, the program does not plan to conduct \nintegrated, systems-level testing in an operational \nenvironment prior to awarding the first production lot \ncontract. Officials stated that component and lab testing will \nallow them to mitigate technical risks prior to the first \nproduction decision. Further, they stated that they are \nmanaging risk by implementing decision points for each lot, to \nallow decision-makers more opportunities to evaluate \nhardware maturity and production readiness. Without the \nintegrated testing, the program faces increased risk of costly \nand time intensive design changes and retrofits if issues are \ndiscovered in flight testing. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \nstated that B-52 CERP uses digital engineering best practices \nwhere practical to integrate modern systems into the B-52, \nand that it used digital modeling and digital engineering to \nassist the inlet redesign completed in December 2024. \nAccording to the program, analysis shows the inlet now meets \nperformance and operability requirements. It added that \nrecent contract actions increased cost and schedule maturity \nand that B-52 CERP is progressing toward development start \nin 2025. The program noted that the production strategy \nstrikes a balance between risk and urgency; involves extensive \ncomponent and subsystem testing in integration laboratories \nand is augmented by digital modeling; and is structured to \nreduce risk prior to production. It stated that the production \ndecision will occur after two test aircraft are delivered, and \nflight testing will be underway for 18 months prior to \nbeginning the first production aircraft modification."

Since our last assessment, the\nprogram office notified the Air Force senior acquisition\nexecutive that it will breach the baseline schedule for\nproduction start and initial operational capability. Program\nofficials delayed the first and second low-rate production\ndecisions by 11 months each. They are now planned for the\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2026 and second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2027, respectively. Program officials stated that\nchallenges related to environmental qualification, parts\nprocurement, and software contributed to these delays, and\nacknowledged the delays will result in cost increases. Program\nofficials also noted a revised cost estimate will not be\navailable until summer 2025.\nThe program stated that it is using two integration and \ndevelopment labs to test developmental hardware. Since our \nlast assessment, the radar development lab received its \nauthority to operate in August 2024, and the radar system \nintegration lab is expected to receive authority to operate \napproval in May 2025. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program office stated that, in October 2024, the Air Force \ndirected it to address and correct expanding development \ntimelines and increased costs, while also delivering a \nminimum viable capability. This pivot could provide the \nprogram with an opportunity to embrace an iterative \ndevelopment effort, wherein the minimum viable product’s \ndesign matures with each iteration, resources are based on \ndemonstrated achievement, and potential problems are \nidentified early through collaboration with stakeholders. We \nwill continue to monitor these efforts. \nHowever, B-52 RMP is not employing digital engineering \nleading practices such as creating a digital twin or using a \ndigital thread, which can provide predictive knowledge about \na system’s performance and allow for faster design iterations. \nProgram officials explained that a digital twin or thread is \ndifficult and costly to develop, largely due to 20-year-old \nradar hardware design. We have found that the adoption of \nmodern tools and methods could help optimize production, \nensure the system works as intended, and increase future \nagility to ensure the system remains relevant and effective. \nFor example, knowledge in the digital thread informs \ndecision-making through the product life cycle, such as \nwhether to make certain changes to the product’s design. \nThe program is also not validating integrated hardware and \nsoftware in an operational environment prior to production. \nOfficials stated that they are updating the program’s \nacquisition strategy so that the first low-rate production lot \nwill be procured in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026 after \nthe first low-rate production decision. However, the \nproduction decision will occur about 2 years before system-\nlevel flight testing or a system verification review is complete. \nThe program office explained that the first low-rate \nproduction decision requires that a manufacturing readiness \nassessment be conducted and hardware maturity be \ndemonstrated. However, these demonstrations will be limited \nto ground testing and a small amount of flight testing. \nAdditionally, the program’s plans to test a physical prototype \nafter making a production decision—and its decision to begin \nLot 1 production based on immature software functionality—\nincreases the risk of costly, time-intensive rework if the \nprogram discovers issues later. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program’s decision to begin production in the fourth \nquarter of fiscal year 2026 is at risk due to software \nchallenges. However, officials stated that the milestone \ndecision authority will assess the risk in software to \ndetermine if it is sufficiently mitigated before approving the \nfirst low-rate production decision. Program officials \ncurrently assess software development and integration as \nhigh risk, due to the need for mature software before flight \ntesting. According to the program office, delays in s oftware \ndevelopment are due to a lack of integration lab hardware \nand a higher-than-expected number of defects. The \ncompletion of some risk mitigation steps was delayed and \nwill consequently be 3 months late to need. In addition, \naccording to program offic ials, these challenges, along with \nlower-than-expected contractor performance, resulted in an \nincrease in software costs. \nThe program office stated that it completed an updated \nmission-based risk assessment process report for \ncybersecurity in May 2024, which includes significant \nassessment updates since the report’s 2021 issuance. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \nstated that B-52 RMP addresses an urgent need to replace \nthe aging and increasingly unsustainable APQ-166 and that \nfielding a reliable all-weather navigation and targeting \ncapability is critically important to provide a viable, credible \ndeterrent through 2050. It added that B-52 RMP is in \ndevelopment and working through known risks of lab \navailability, software development, and production \naffordability. Finally, the program office stated that given the \nperturbations in the B-52 RMP program schedule, the \nprogram is considering new development approaches to \nstrike an effective balance between cost, risk, and timely \ndelivery of capability to the warfighter."

Air Force officials said \nthat they now plan to begin production by the second quarter \nof fiscal year 2026 before completing the E-7A RP MTA rapid \nprototyping effort by initiating a separate, concurrent \nprogram on the major capability acquisition pathway. They \nsaid that it was necessary to begin production concurrently \nwith the E-7A RP rapid prototyping effort to offset the lead \ntime associated with the build and subsequent modification \nof the aircraft. \nThe program definitized its contract with Boeing since our last \nassessment. After the contract was definitized, Boeing \ndelayed the first flight test by 9 months to May 2027. \nAccording to Air Force officials, the delay was due to a late-\nbreaking, required critical security architecture change that \naffected the procurement of parts, qualification testing, and \nmodification of the airframe. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe E-7A RP program initiated its effort with defined \nminimum system requirements with the goal of delivering \nsystems meeting those requirements quickly, program \nofficials noted. To accomplish this, the Air Force identified \nan existing design that it planned to modify based on \nadditional prioritized requirements to develop a minimum \nviable product. The program reported that it intends to \nenable continued iterative development by using a modular \nopen systems approach and re -architecture of mission \nsystem software. \nProgram officials also said that they plan to use an iterative \ndesign approach based on feedback from users for certain \ncomponents of the system, such as software and other mission \nsystems. For example, the E-7A RP program office made an \nagreement with end users in December 2023 to ensure that \ncertain end users, such as air battle managers who provide \nairborne command and control, were available to provide input \nduring the development process. For example, if a frequently \nused command was nested several layers down in the menu \nsystem, an operator could suggest bringing that command \nhigher in the stack to improve efficiency. \nThe program reported it has begun developing a digital thread \nthat sustains authoritative data throughout the life of the \nprogram, but not a digital twin—a virtual representation of \nthe physical product. Our prior work found that digital twins \nand threads provide real-time data to inform production \ndecisions and provide efficiencies throughout development, \noperations, and sustainment. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nProgram officials said that one of their primary goals for \nsoftware development is to refactor and re -architect the \nexisting mission systems software to better support future \nupgrades and new capabilities. The program office reported \nthat software development is a moderate risk, due in part to \nthe time frames to complete development before \ndevelopmental testing. The contractor is leading the \nsoftware development effort and is supported by Air Force \nsoftware developers.  \nAccording to the program, its cybersecurity strategy includes \na Zero Trust foundation, with provisions to support additional \nimprovements in overall cybersecurity while minimizing the \nneed for hardware modifications. It stated that it plans to \nconduct cybersecurity assessments iteratively throughout the \nsoftware development cycle. \nOther Program Issues \nAir Force officials said costs increased on the MTA rapid \nprototyping effort due to higher-than-expected estimates for \nupdating hardware and software. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program \noffice for review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate.  \nThe program stated that the Air Force definitized the MTA \nrapid prototyping effort contract in August 2024 to deliver \ntwo operationally capable E -7A prototype aircraft in fiscal \nyear 2028. It noted that the Air Force will use information \nfrom the effort to  seek approval to enter E- 7A production by \nthe end of 2025. In addition, the program stated that the Air \nForce is focused on delivering the E -7A RP aircraft and \npreparing to procure a fleet of E -7A aircraft to meet \nwarfighter airborne command and control a nd moving \ntarget requirements.  \nThe program added that the total acquisition cost increase \nof 33 percent resulted from updated methodologies to \ninclude additional scope related to non -recurring \nengineering, with the primary drivers being software and air \nvehicle subsystems."

According to officials, the full-rate production decision was delayed due \nto longer than expected modification timelines. The Air Force reported \nawarding the related contract in January 2025. \nThe program continues to experience installation schedule and supply risks \nnoted in our last assessment. According to program officials, the prime \ncontractor made improvements to address delays installing EPAWSS \nmodifications on F-15E aircraft, but it faces bottlenecks in the process due to \nworkforce issues and legacy aircraft issues discovered during the modification \nprocess. As a result, the program has been challenged with establishing a \npredictable installation schedule. To offset these delays at the prime contractor, \nthe Air Force started installing EPAWSS during planned F-15E depot \nmaintenance periods in 2024. The program continues to track diminishing \nmanufacturing sources (DMS) and reported an additional eight DMS \nnotifications from suppliers since October 2023. \nThe program did not identify a minimum viable product during system \ndevelopment. Program officials stated that this was because the EPAWSS’s \nperformance parameters were already defined in a development contract, \nreducing flexibility. Officials added that future upgrades to fielded units will use \na continuous development and integration approach where the content of the \nupgrades can change based on user needs and software maturity. The program \nreported plans to incorporate a modular open systems approach for a signal \nprocessor with the aim to facilitate upgrades.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment.

It delivered \nthe final two aircraft in Lot 1B (EX-7/EX-8) in June 2024, and placed a Lot 5 \nproduction order in July 2024 and a Lot 6 production order in January 2025. This \nbrings the total aircraft on contract to 98. Lot 2 aircraft are expected to begin \ndelivery in early 2025. The Air Force decreased its planned total quantities from \n104 to 98 as it refines its investment priorities. \nThe F-15EX program is tracking three risks. First, Boeing must increase its \nproduction rate from one to two aircraft per month by April 2026 to meet its \nfuture delivery requirements. Boeing experienced quality deficiencies—due, in \npart, to fuselage manufacturing processes—on Lot 1B aircraft that required \ntime-consuming rework, which it took steps to mitigate. Program officials stated \nthat Boeing reduced the amount of rework from 25 percent in August 2023 to 8 \npercent in September 2024, but noted further reductions are needed.  \nIn addition, parts shortages—including display screens, a gun system, ejection \nseat propellant devices, and titanium components—remain a production risk. \nTo address these shortages, program officials said that they continue to visit \nsuppliers to negotiate prioritization of F-15EX orders, the purchase of remaining \nsupply stocks, and other steps to obtain needed parts. \nFinally, program officials recognized that the F-15EX design may not meet Air \nForce cybersecurity requirements because the original aircraft design—used in \nforeign military sales—was not required to do so. The program completed cyber \nvulnerability testing in June 2024 on Lot 1B aircraft, which officials said reduced \nthis risk. The program plans to conduct additional cyber testing in early 2025 on \nLot 2 aircraft to further characterize and mitigate this risk. \nProgram officials said that they started implementing leading product \ndevelopment practices. For example, they applied user feedback from Air Force \nF-15EX pilots and designed the F-15EX to accommodate future upgrades.\nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment.

F-22 \nofficials said that the sensor enhancement hardware used \nduring these demonstrations was not integrated with the \naircraft but operated independently from other systems. \nOfficials said that these demonstrations determined that the \nsensor enhancement hardware could perform in an F-22 \nenvironment, which met the Air Force’s criteria for moving \nfrom rapid prototyping to rapid fielding. \nIn August 2024, the program reported awarding a contract \nthat it said was to produce the first batch of hardware. The \nprogram plans to conduct a flight test with the sensor \nenhancements integrated with F -22 aircraft in 2026. Officials \nreported that the program is planning to transition to the \nmajor capability acquisition pathway for sensor \nenhancements in fiscal year 2026. Then, the program is \nexpected to make the full -rate production decision in fiscal \nyear 2027. After making this decision, the program exp ects \nto complete receiving deliveries of F- 22 hardware planned \nunder the rapid fielding effort. According to the program, it \nhas yet to transition to the major capability acquisition \npathway because it still needs flight test data to support a \nproduction d ecision. In the meantime, it is using the MTA \npathway to mitigate production schedule gaps.  \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported this year that the F-22 SeE effort is not \ncontinuing to incorporate leading practices that it \nimplemented in the F-22 RP effort. For example, it stated that \nit has limitations refining requirements based on feedback \nfrom users and stakeholders into subsequent iterations of \ncapability—the foundation of an iterative approach. The \nprogram stated that it considers its development approach \niterative in that it performs monthly tests of software \nreleases, conducts flight tests to fix defects, and implements \npilot feedback prior to fielding capability. In addition, it said it \nhas plans to continue aircraft and sensor software \ndevelopment in follow-on releases. Even so, it acknowledged \nthat the high concurrency of hardware and software \ndevelopment within the program limits the timely discovery \nof integration issues, and its ability to refine design. We \npreviously reported that in modern iterative development, \nrequirements are defined in concert with demonstrated \nachievement and development is focused on users and \nmission effect. \nThe program plans to validate design with a system-level \nintegrated physical prototype in 2027. But, it will not connect \ndata from the test to a digital twin or digital thread because it \ndoes not plan to have either of those digital tools. It stated \nthat F-22 platform-level efforts exist for digital modeling and \nsimulation and that its long-term plan would include modeling \nlegacy functionality for ongoing modernization efforts. The \nprogram noted that considerable investment would be \nneeded to develop digital tools. Our prior work found that \ndigital twins and threads provide real-time data to inform \nproduction decisions and could reduce the program’s \nconcurrency risk of proceeding with multiple acquisition \nphases at the same time. \nCybersecurity \nThe program reported that it received approval of a \ncybersecurity strategy in October 2024 but has yet to conduct \nsome cybersecurity assessments, such as cyber tabletop \nexercises and adversarial assessments. The program plans to \ncomplete these assessments in 2027. We previously reported \nthat early and regular discovery of mission-impacting system \nvulnerabilities reduces risk to schedule, among other things. \nOther Program Issues \nThe program is managing concurrent development and \nproduction of hardware that is needed for developmental and \noperational testing in the 2026 and 2027 time frame. Program \nofficials said that they took on risk by buying the hardware in \nadvance to have it readily available. Until it produces this \nhardware, the program remains uncertain about when it will \nstart testing and said that delayed testing could delay the \nfielding of sensor enhancements as planned. \nF-22 officials said that supply chain issues, particularly for\ncomputer chips, could affect the delivery schedule. They\nnoted the high demand for these chips, complicated military\ntechnology, and competition from commercial enterprises as\ncontributing to the risk. To mitigate this risk, officials plan to\nwork across program offices to improve the capability of\ncommercial suppliers and production capabilities.\nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor comment and incorporated its technical comments where \nappropriate."

The program planned to hold its first design review in \nMarch 2024, but delayed it 6 months until September 2024. \nAccording to officials, the program needed more time to \nfinalize the hardware design. Officials said that the purpose of \nthe delayed review was to validate an initial configuration of \nthe system for use in the first flight test. According to officials, \nanother review, scheduled for 2025, would validate the fully \noperational configuration for use in the final flight tests. \nProgram officials said that the delays will reduce the number \nof flight tests the program can conduct during the 5-year \nrapid prototyping effort from seven to five. These officials said \nthat the program will still be able to establish sufficient \nconfidence in the missile to declare it operational and to meet \nall the MTA’s objectives with the reduced number of tests. \nIn addition to being behind schedule, the contractor is also \nprojecting that it will significantly exceed its cost baseline. \nHowever, program officials reported that removing plans for \ntwo flight tests will reduce the scope of work and provide \nsome cost savings. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe HACM program is implementing some of the leading \nproduct development practices that companies employ to \nsuccessfully develop and deliver products at speed. \nSpecifically, the program is prioritizing capabilities that can be \nfielded quickly and is currently refining requirements to \ndefine the capabilities that it will incorporate into a minimum \nviable product. The program expects to define this initial set \nof capabilities with the conclusion of its final design review in \n2025. Officials stated that the program has solicited user \nfeedback on the missile’s design. The acquisition strategy also \ncreates opportunities to incorporate successive updates. \nThe program implemented the use of a digital thread to \nconnect stakeholders with data about the system, but it does \nnot plan to implement a true digital twin—a dynamic, virtual \nrepresentation of the physical product. However, officials said \nthat they were implementing other digital tools in the design \nphase, including maintaining high-fidelity digital information \nfor every part with a serial number that goes into the design. \nOfficials said they can then assemble these digital \ncomponents into a digital model of the prototype, which can \nbe run through performance-based simulations. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program rated software development as a higher risk \nthan it was last year. Officials said that the program is working \nwith other DOD programs on software development and \nintegration to save time and money. These savings can only \nbe realized if the participating efforts’ schedules remain \naligned and the contractor provides the necessary staffing, \nwhich the program office stated has not occurred. \nThe program reported that its cybersecurity strategy was \nsigned and approved in April 2024. \nOther Program Issues \nAccording to program officials, the HACM program has \nrevised its transition strategy to align with Air Force goals for \nhaving a larger inventory of missiles sooner, while \nsimultaneously improving the manufacturability of the design \nand expanding the capacity of the industrial base. Air Force \nofficials reported ordering additional missiles, separate from \nthe rapid prototyping effort, to allow them to continue to \nimprove the design and prevent a break in production \nbetween the rapid prototyping and rapid fielding efforts. The \nAir Force plans to initiate the rapid fielding effort in fiscal year \n2027. According to program officials, the purpose of the rapid \nfielding effort is to quickly field the missiles developed from \nthe rapid prototyping effort and iterate on the missile's \ndesign, while also making it easier to produce. The work will \nfeed into an overlapping major capability acquisition pathway \nprogram that the Air Force plans to start at production in \nfiscal year 2029. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \noffice stated that based on global power competition and \nurgency to address threats, the Air Force changed the focus of \nthe HACM program from a prototype demonstration to a \nprogram that would deliver operational capability in fiscal \nyear 2027. The program stated that, with this shift, it is \nfocused on meeting schedule as the priority and maintaining \nvelocity toward fielding an operationally relevant capability—\nthe minimum viable product that meets user-defined \nperformance requirements—in fiscal year 2027. According to \nthe program, it is using modelling and simulation, ground test, \nand flight test data to verify and validate system performance \nacross the range of operational scenarios. Finally, the \nprogram nonconcurred with our assessment that it is not \nincorporating MOSA. The program stated that it is employing \na version of the Weapons Open System Architecture standard \nwhich meets many of the criteria for MOSA. \nGAO Response \nWe stand by our assessment of the HACM program’s MOSA \nimplementation because it lacks a requirement for physical \nmodularity."

This is due to recurring issues with the redesigned RVS \nand refueling boom—a rigid telescope that delivers fuel to the receiver aircraft. \nAs we previously reported, issues with the original subsystems can cause the \noperator to scratch stealth aircraft with the boom due to visual acuity and \ndepth perception problems. The Air Force continues to procure more KC-46As \nthat will need to be retrofitted with the redesigned subsystems. As of January \n2025, the Air Force procured 158 total aircraft and Boeing delivered 89 of them, \naccording to the program office. The program also said that Boeing and the Air \nForce are addressing issues found in operational testing with the wing aerial \nrefueling pods. This will inform the revised required assets available date.  \nBoeing is updating delivered aircraft with an interim software solution to \nprovide operator performance improvements until it can begin retrofitting the \naircraft with the redesigned RVS, currently planned by the end of 2026. An \nofficial said that operators provided feedback on the software before Boeing \nfielded the interim solution and the Air Force plans to incorporate the feedback \non the redesigned RVS, consistent with leading practices. \nIn 2023, the Air Force discovered cracked air ducts due to high vibrations from a \npump during aerial refueling operations. In July 2024, Boeing conducted flight \ntests with new operating procedures to mitigate the risk of further damage to \nthe ducts while it conducts a root cause analysis to determine a permanent \nsolution. Officials stated that Boeing is responsible for any costs associated with \nfixing this issue.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment. The program office provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated where appropriate. The program office stated that Boeing is \nprogressing toward flight tests for the revised RVS and boom starting in 2025; it \nis engaged with Boeing to address issues with the aerial refueling pods prior to \nfielding; and it is focused on production quality and mitigating delivery delays. \nLastly, the program is working on an air-duct cracking solution while Boeing \ncontinues to repair any damaged aircraft to return to the fleet."

In July 2024, for the program to continue, the \nUndersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment \ncertified that the program is essential to national security and \nthat no alternatives exist that would provide an acceptable \ncapability to meet the military requirement at a lower cost. As \npart of the certification, DOD rescinded Sentinel’s approval to \nstart development and its acquisition program baseline from \nSeptember 2020. DOD directed the Air Force to, among other \nthings, restructure the program to address the root causes of \nthe critical cost breach and to ensure it has an appropriate \nmanagement structure to prevent future cost growth. \nAs of September 2024, Sentinel program officials indicated \nthat this restructuring was ongoing and they are reevaluating \nseveral parts of the acquisition approach and design of the \nweapon system, including the launch facilities. As part of the \nreassessment process, the Office of the Director, Cost \nAssessment and Program Evaluation determined that a \nreasonably modified Sentinel program with redesigned launch \nfacilities could cost about 81 percent more than the \nSeptember 2020 cost estimate, or $170.6 billion (in fiscal year \n2025 dollars). \nAccording to the program, two of its 18 critical technologies \nare mature, while 15 are approaching maturity. One critical \ntechnology is undergoing design changes and the program \nwas not able to provide a maturity level. The program plans to \nmature and demonstrate most of the technologies during its \nfirst flight and full system functional tests, currently planned \nfor March 2028 and December 2030, respectively. Given that \nthe program’s critical technologies remain immature more \nthan 4 years after starting development, it calls into question \nthe level of work required to mature these technologies and \nthe validity of the cost estimate used to certify the program. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe Sentinel program reported that it created initial digital \nthreads for design artifacts, requirements, and architecture, \nand is working to extend the threads to detailed product \ndesign and verification. The program noted that it will develop \nand refine a minimum viable product as part of its acquisition \nstrategy and systems engineering plan. Additionally, the \nprogram reported plans to update system engineering \ndocuments and its digital engineering strategy to reflect \nincorporation of a digital twin. According to the program, it \nwill complete development of the twin by the time of its full \noperational capability—a date yet to be determined. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nSentinel’s software development, which began in January \n2021, continues to progress more slowly than anticipated, \nand the program’s software metrics remain behind schedule. \nThe certification for software needed for first flight has \nslipped 4 years. This software increment is planned to be one \nof the smallest and least complex of Sentinel’s software \ndevelopment efforts. The delay has raised concerns from \nprogram officials about the prime contractor’s ability to \ncomplete the program’s software in a timely manner. The \nprogram is updating the software development plan as part of \nthe larger restructuring process following the critical breach. \nProgram officials stated that while cybersecurity testing was \nrequired, the prime contractor claimed it was unclear as to \nwhat type of testing was needed. As a result, program officials \nplan to clarify this as part of the ongoing restructuring effort. \nIn addition, program officials stated that they are updating \nthe entire cybersecurity strategy to ensure they adequately \nconduct cyber testing on all necessary components. \nOther Program Issues \nThe program continues to evaluate options to potentially \nredesign portions of the system for cost reductions. It has \nidentified developing a reliable schedule and designs for the \nlaunch facilities and launch centers as necessary items for \nunderstanding the program’s true cost, but it is unclear when \nthese may be finalized due to the ongoing restructuring \neffort. Additionally, several portions of the missile design \nremain immature, which could also affect the program’s cost. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. According to the \nprogram, it made incremental strides in refining and \nrestructuring. It stated that the areas it initially considered key \nto restructure were: collaboration with external stakeholders \nto reevaluate and validate program requirements; \norganizational restructuring; and advancement of mature \nsegments while evaluating changes to the acquisition \nstrategy. The program added that it prioritized understanding \nand addressing systemic issues impacting performance. It \nstated that its effort to that end involved several aspects, \nincluding: a deep dive into management structures and \npartnership with the prime contractor; changes to systems \nengineering processes and infrastructure deployment; \nprioritizing partnerships and open communication; and \nintegrated processes to deliver critical deterrence capabilities. \nThe program noted that it aimed to establish a more robust \nand efficient framework for execution, and that its approach \nunderscores the Air Force’s commitment to starting \ndevelopment and fostering a collaborative, integrated \nenvironment conducive to success."

The missile’s technology maturity showed a slight \nimprovement from our last assessment, but three of the six \ncritical technologies are still approaching maturity. They are \nexpected to be fully mature in fiscal year 2025, about 4 years \nafter development start. DOE also identified critical \ntechnologies for the warhead, of which only 35 percent are \nconsidered mature. This is lower than what we previously \nreported, as DOE officials stated that they mistakenly \nidentified several technologies at higher maturity levels last \nyear. DOE does not expect to mature all the warhead \ntechnologies until fiscal year 2026. Like the missile’s \ntechnology status, and consistent with our December 2024 \nreport on DOE’s nuclear weapon acquisitions, the warhead \nfalls short of the long-standing best practice to start \ndevelopment with mature technologies and creates risk for \nfuture cost increases and schedule delays. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe Air Force is not using an iterative approach for \ndevelopment of the missile with no plans to have a minimum \nviable product. Instead, the Air Force plans to field the full \ncapability in a single increment with no options to iterate and \nprovide additional capability. Program officials stated that \nthey executed some basic elements of a minimum viable \nproduct approach, such as refining requirements with users \nprior to placing them on the development contract.  \nThe Air Force is not currently using a digital twin and is still \ndeveloping a digital thread. These are data sharing tools that \nleading companies use to virtually test functionality, uncover \ndesign problems, and inform their decision-making. While the \nAir Force plans to develop a future digital twin for key \nsubsystems, our leading practices found that digital twins at \nthe overall system level provide an enhanced opportunity to \nunderstand how fully-integrated systems will perform. \nProgram officials expect to complete development of a digital \nthread in 2028 for use during production and sustainment. \nThe program identified potential production constraints \nand plans to complete an industrial base assessment in \nApril 2025 to assess manufacturing capacity. The program \nuses a modular open systems approach with system \ninterfaces and architectures that allow  for future upgrades \nto some components such as avionics and sensors. The \nprogram is requesting  procurement funding in fiscal year \n2025 for long -lead items. With developmental testing \nongoing until September 2026, the program risks that any \ndeficiencies th is testing finds could require design changes \nto these long -lead items.  \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program delivered eight of 13 software releases with \nnuclear certification of the software continuing to be a \nprogram watch area. According to program officials, an \nindependent review team found evidence that the software \ndoes not meet certain nuclear safety requirements outlined in \nAir Force policy. The program office and prime contractor are \nworking to resolve this issue, but LRSO risks not using as much \nof the existing software as planned, which could lead to \ndelays if additional software development is needed. \nProgram officials reported delays to the remaining \ncybersecurity assessments. They attributed these delays to \nprioritizing other test efforts and ensuring system maturity for \nfuture cybersecurity tests. The program plans the next \nassessment for September 2025 with a final, full system \nassessment now 2 years later, in September 2027. According \nto program officials, these delays will not affect the start of \nproduction or initial operational capability.\n \nOther Program Issues \nSince development start, the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense’s (OSD) independent production cost estimate has \nbeen $1.9 billion more than the Air Force’s estimate. We \npreviously reported that OSD agreed to update its \nindependent estimate as test missile production data became \navailable. Completion of this update is currently scheduled for \nthe summer of 2025. As part of this update, Air Force officials \nstated that they plan to work with OSD to fully understand \nLRSO production costs and provide better cost estimation in \nsupport of the program’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.  \nDOE officials stated that they are not using a minimum viable \nproduct, digital twin, or digital thread for development of the \nwarhead. They are using an existing digital infrastructure \ncharacterized by varying levels of fidelity to aid some warhead \ndesign and testing efforts during its development. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. According to the Air Force, LRSO remains on \ntrack to complete development—maturing its technology, \nsoftware, and cybersecurity at an appropriate pace—to meet \nplanned production and on-time weapon system fielding. \nOfficials added that LRSO successfully completed nine ground \nand four flight tests, providing them with high confidence in \nthe missile’s design and technical maturity. DOE officials \nstated that the warhead’s technology will be more than 80 \npercent mature by the end of fiscal year 2025 in support of its \nfinal design review. They stated that this keeps the warhead \non track to meet its first production unit milestone in fiscal \nyear 2027."

The program has taken steps, such as identifying \nadditional suppliers, to make up delivery time and minimize production delays \nand expects to resolve these challenges by the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. \nInitial capability for both the F/A-18E/F and F-35 are delayed since our last \nassessment. Program officials attributed F/A-18E/F delays to weather, aircraft \nmaintenance, aircraft not having priority on the test range for flight testing, and \nissues discovered during operational testing, such as problems with the \ncryptographic keys that improve information security. Officials stated they are \ntrying to determine what additional testing to perform to achieve initial \ncapability, which is now delayed by about a year. While SDB II is ready for \ntesting on the F-35, the F-35 is still working through its own software \ndevelopment issues that continue to delay SDB II integration and testing.

      "text": "Air Force Program Type: MDAP Common Name: T-7A  \n \n \nPage 86 U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \n \n \nT-7A Program \nProgram Performance \nThe T-7A program reported that it continues to concurrently \ndevelop key aspects of the aircraft, such as the flight \nsoftware, while testing the aircraft. At the same time, the \ncontractor decided to begin production using its own funding \nin 2022, even though the Air Force had yet to place a delivery \norder for production aircraft. As a result, the T-7A is being \ndeveloped and produced with high concurrency, which is a \nhigh-risk programmatic approach as delays in one area could \naffect other aspects of the program. \nIn the last year, T-7A development issues, such as engine \nproblems and other unplanned maintenance on test jets, \nfurther delayed flight testing by about 6 months, according to \nprogram officials. As of October 2024, officials said the \nprogram completed approximately 360 of at least 1,100—or \n33 percent—test points needed for the Air Force’s upcoming \nJanuary 2026 production decision. If all test points are not \ncompleted, the program will likely lack information needed to \ndetermine readiness to begin production. Program officials \nsaid that testing flight control software under stressing \nmaneuvers may not be completed prior to the planned \nproduction decision. They noted that completion of flight test \ncriteria to support the first phased production decision is \ntargeted for October 2025. \nWhile the program progressed in testing the escape system, it \ndoes not plan to qualify it until after the January 2026 \nproduction decision. Additionally, testing of a system-level \nintegrated prototype, which will include linking the Ground-\nBased Training System with the aircraft in flight, is not \nexpected until early- to mid-2026—more than 2 years later \nthan the program reported last year. At that point, the \nGround-Based Training System may still not employ the final \nversion of the 8K simulator projector—a key component of \nthe system. The program reported that, as of January 2025, it \nhad isolated the cause for persistent projector stability issues \nand expects to correct the issues by the end of March 2025. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program stated that it does not plan to develop a digital \ntwin or digital thread, or connect its system-level integrated \ntest results to a digital environment, due to not having \nprocured the requisite data as part of the development \ncontract. Our prior work found that digital twins and digital \nthreads provide real-time testing and validation data to \ninform production decisions and could reduce the program’s \nconcurrency risk. \nAdditionally, the T-7A program did not follow an iterative \ndevelopment approach, which we previously found allows \nleading companies to refine operational needs into an MVP \nand deliver essential technologies with speed. Program \nofficials explained that the original acquisition strategy was to \npursue a technically mature product that would require \nminimal development. However, with the delays facing the \nprogram, the Air Force approved a phased and highly \nconcurrent approach that allows for low-rate production \ndeliveries in parallel with completion of development to \nmitigate further delays in providing aircraft to the user. This \napproach may result in deliveries that require future updates, \nand program officials said they are working with Air Force Air \nEducation and Training Command stakeholders to reassess \nprogram requirements against the minimum user needs for \ninitial production aircraft. Program officials noted that the T-\n7A design employs a modular open systems approach for \ninterfaces between major systems and components. This \napproach enables incremental changes to major components \nthroughout the aircraft’s life cycle. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program stated that the flight control software version \ndelivered at the end of 2024 brought full functionality and \ncritical fixes for flight control laws, which it expected to \nenable the aircraft to complete developmental testing. \nSubsequent versions will address issues that arise during \nremaining flight testing.  \nThe program identified a range of vulnerabilities by \nconducting key developmental cybersecurity tests and has \naddressed several high-risk vulnerabilities through iterative \ntests. Continued developmental testing is planned to address \nadditional vulnerabilities before operational testing. \nOther Program Issues \nThe T-7A program delayed its initial operational capability \ndate by nearly 1 year, to January 2028. Program officials said \nthat initial operational capability depends on having 14 \noperational jets that, officials said, the Air Force will not have \nfunding for until a year later than originally planned. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and incorporated its technical comments where \nappropriate. It stated that source selection resulted in a very \ncompetitive price and schedule and fixed-price contracts \nconstrained cost growth, but the schedule experienced \nsignificant delays. The program added that to mitigate further \ndelays, it allowed production to commence before \ndevelopment concludes. It noted that the approach \naccelerates the program but introduces concurrency risks for \nboth the government and Boeing, and that it implemented \nmanagement strategies to support production and expedite \ndevelopment completion. In April 2025, the Air Force \nreported that the program had completed 50 percent of the \ntest points for the production decision and that it is targeting \ninitial operational capability to occur in November 2027."

Boeing shifted its focus from implementing \nnew modifications to clearing the rework backlog and \ncompleting existing designs. \nBoeing has yet to resolve four schedule risks that we reported \non previously: \n• Boeing continues to work on design issues related to \ndecompression and the environmental control system \nthat contribute to excess noise in the aircraft cabin, \namong other things. According to VC-25B officials, Boeing \nis conducting an aircraft-wide decompression study and \nanticipates making design changes to mitigate issues. \n• Boeing is continuing to work on its wiring design and \nexpects to complete the remaining 10 percent of the \nbaseline design in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. \nProgram officials said that Boeing started wiring racks, \npanels, and cabinets, but the wiring has yet to be installed \non the aircraft. Program officials previously noted that \nwiring delays contributed to modification rework and \naffected timely completion of other work on the aircraft. \n• Boeing still faces challenges hiring and retaining qualified \nmechanics due to ongoing market conditions, according \nto VC-25B officials. Program officials said that approval \nrates for mechanics to acquire necessary clearances \nremain a workforce limitation. \n• Boeing continues to deliver test plans. However, \naccording to program officials, a significant amount of \ntest plans remains with Boeing pending completion of \ncertification plans and aircraft design. \nProgram officials noted that Boeing’s proposed schedule does \nnot include time between the end of developmental testing \nand the start of operational testing, which could provide time \nto fix unexpected discoveries and avoid additional test delays. \nThey said that unexpected discoveries during testing could \naffect Boeing’s ability to meet future milestones. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe VC-25B program has not implemented leading product \ndevelopment practices, which we have found help companies \ndeliver complex products with speed. Program officials said \nthat the program has specific performance parameters that \ncannot be modified so iterative development was not \npossible. In addition, they said that VC-25B had no \nrequirement for digital engineering for virtualization or \ncreation of a digital twin at development start. They also said \nit is not cost effective to test a system-level prototype \nbecause the program is integrating mature technology into \ntwo commercial aircraft. However, even though the program \nis well into development, the adoption of modern tools and \nmethods could help ensure the system works as intended \nthroughout operations and increase future agility so that the \nsystem remains relevant and effective. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nAs we previously reported, VC-25B officials said that \ncommercial derivative aircraft are required to meet Federal \nAviation Administration software and cybersecurity standards \nto obtain certification. Officials also stated that cybersecurity \nrequirements were excluded from the contract due to the risk \nof modifying commercial systems to address them. The \nprogram office plans to conduct cybersecurity assessments in \nthe future. \nOther Program Issues \nIn February 2024, Boeing provided a revised schedule to the \nprogram office that projected a delay of 2.5 years in aircraft \ndelivery, from May 2027 to December 2029. Program officials \nsaid that the revised schedule incorporated risk related to \nfinishing design and aircraft modification and provides detail \nup to first flight. They expect Boeing to provide the remaining \nschedule in early 2025 and will then conduct a schedule risk \nassessment and update the program’s baseline schedule. \nProgram officials stated that unplanned aircraft maintenance \ncould negatively affect aircraft materiel availability. They said \nthat some maintenance tasks were not included in the \noriginal contract and will have to be completed before first \nflight of the first aircraft. Officials also said that they plan to \nestablish contracts for these tasks to avoid delays. \nBoeing discovered stress-corrosion cracks on the 747-8 \ncommercial fleet in 2019. Repairs of VC-25B cracks on certain \naircraft support structures were expected to be completed by \nsummer 2023 but are still ongoing, according to program \nofficials. The officials stated that inspections will continue for \nthe life of the aircraft and that the program is still evaluating \nthe effect of additional inspections required by the Federal \nAviation Administration. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. The program office stated that it will continue to \nwork with Boeing to manage all program risks to modify, test, \nand deliver presidential mission-ready VC-25B aircraft."

Additionally, the Army is currently negotiating with \nBoeing for three Block II aircraft using fiscal year 2024 \nfunding. The Army is updating cost and schedule estimates for \nthe production decision with a new program baseline \nexpected prior to the end of fiscal year 2025. Further, \naccording to the Army, technical requirements are stable, and \ninitial capability date is to be determined. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported that it is not using an iterative \napproach—including developing a minimum viable product or \ndigital twin for development—due to the CH-47 Chinook \nsystem operating in the fleet for more than 60 years and the \napproaching end of the system development phase. However, \nthe program incorporated user and stakeholder feedback \nthrough various activities. It established a working group of \nstakeholders that meets every 2 weeks to discuss computer \nresources, invited industry stakeholders to join a software \nreview board, and held quarterly design reviews to obtain \nuser feedback on software capabilities. Our prior work has \nshown that leading companies collaborate closely with a wide \nrange of stakeholders—such as users, engineers, and \nmanufacturers—to identify potential problems early and \nprovide feedback on desired product improvements to inform \nsubsequent iterations. \nAlthough the program reported that it did not develop a \ndigital thread, officials said that benefits of a digital thread \nmethodology include streamlined requirements analysis, \ndesign evaluation and optimization, and developmental and \noperational tests, amo ng others. Many of these have been in \nplace for approximately 20 years. The program plans to \nexplore the lessons learned from other Army programs \nimplementing their own digital threads, as well as \nopportunities to develop a digital thread as the system \nchanges to align with modular open system architecture \nimplementation.  \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program considers its development of software to be low \nrisk. Remaining risk factors include completion of software \nneeded to support Block II operational tests, upcoming \nhardware changes requiring software changes, and the \navailability of software integration facilities for developmental \nhardware. According to the program, mitigation plans are in \nplace to address these concerns. \nAccording to the program, cybersecurity continues to pose a \nmoderate risk to the program because of the vulnerabilities \nidentified during a key cybersecurity assessment. Additionally, \naccording to the program, after completion of a classified \nreport, a contract was awarded in June 2024 to address \nvulnerabilities identified during testing. \nOther Program Issues \nThe Army reported that current funding may not be adequate \nto address known obsolescence issues. These include the \nneed to qualify new material for the rotor blades, and to \ndesign and integrate replacement items, including the cockpit \nvoice and data recorder. Army officials stated that they are \nworking with the manufacturer to ensure the materials are \navailable to support production needs. \nInadequate funding could negatively affect the industrial base \nand degrade supplier predictability, according to the Army. \nFor example, the program encountered obsolescence issues \nrelated to the industrial base during the 7-year gap between \ndevelopment start and the Army decision to rebalance its \naviation investments in 2024. As a result, the industrial base is \na moderate risk. According to the Army, mitigation plans \ninclude supporting foreign military sales to provide stability \nand predictability to suppliers. According to the program, an \nindustrial base assessment has been completed and is in the \napproval process. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which were \nincorporated as appropriate. After our January 31, 2025, \ncutoff date for new information, the Army stated that the \nArmy Requirements Oversight Council reduced the total \nprogram quantity to 432 CH-47F Block II aircraft, with an \nadditional 69 MH-47G aircraft. According to the Army, in \nsupport of the February 2024 aviation investment rebalance \ndecision, the CH-47 program office continues to work with \nstakeholders to develop production documentation to \nsupport a fiscal year 2025 low-rate production decision. In \naddition, according to the Army, the program office began \ndelivering production representative Block II aircraft. Finally, \nthe Army stated that Block II is adequately funded to qualify \nthe system."

However, officials reported that \nthe program’s critical technologies were not fully mature at \nthat time. The program plans for the technologies to be fully \nmature at production start—a date that program \ndocumentation targets for the first quarter of fiscal year 2029 \nbut also indicates could be as late as the third quarter of fiscal \nyear 2030. According to our best practices for technology \nreadiness, programs should fully mature all critical \ntechnologies in an operational environment by the start of \nsystem development. We previously found that MTA \nprograms transitioning with immature technologies may risk \ncostly and time-intensive redesign work for the overall effort. \nDOD’s Office of the Under Secretary of Research and \nEngineering conducted a system-level preliminary design \nreview and a schedule risk assessment for FLRAA in March \n2024. The review stated that the program is at high risk to \nmeet its planned milestone dates due to various delays but \nallowed the program to progress into detailed design. \nSchedule risk analysis showed that delays for the program’s \nstart of production and initial operating capability could be \napproximately 18 and 11 months, respectively. \nIn addition, the preliminary design review also stated that the \naircraft’s weight growth is putting certain planned mission \ncapabilities, particularly regarding payload, at moderate risk. \nWhile the review noted that FLRAA has a plan to reduce \napproximately 270 pounds of weight, this falls short of the \n2,000-pound reduction needed to reduce the payload risk \nfrom medium to low. Program officials stated that they are \nplanning to conduct a system-level critical design review in \nlate fiscal year 2025. \nFLRAA officials reported that they plan to take delivery of two \nvirtual prototypes by the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. \nThese virtual prototypes consist of a crew station simulator \nand a digital engineering model of the FLRAA aircraft and \nmission equipment. The program expects these prototypes to \nlend insight into system design, integration, and \ndevelopmental testing. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe FLRAA program, an Army-designated “pathfinder” \nprogram for pioneering the department’s digital engineering \nefforts, reported that it incorporated multiple leading \npractices for product development. Our prior work shows that \nthese practices allow for design, validation, and delivery of \ncomplex products with speed. \nAmong these practices, the program reported that it \ncompleted an iterative process to establish a minimum viable \nproduct, documented plans for a digital twin, and initiated \ndevelopment of a digital thread. It also expects to complete \ntesting of system-level integrated physical prototypes in an \noperational environment in fiscal year 2028, and to connect \nthe data from the testing to a digital twin or thread.  \nFLRAA officials stated that the digital twin will allow for \ncontinuous analysis on the system without using physical \nassets and that the twin will be developed iteratively. \nAccording to these officials, they made progress over the last \nyear in addressing challenges related to access and use of the \ndigital twin. For example, they said that they successfully \nresolved initial challenges with stakeholder access to the twin \nas well as identified potential solutions to the challenges as \npart of an aviation digital engineering roadmap. \nThe program also reported that it implemented a modular \nopen systems approach. As part of this approach, the \nprogram established technical performance measures and \nmaturity targets. The program anticipates that a modular \napproach will help to minimize future technology integration \nefforts and lower costs during sustainment. \n \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe independent technical risk assessment for FLRAA rated \nthe software risk for the program as medium. It also noted \nthat the program office still needs to determine some \nportions of the design. The program’s cybersecurity strategy \nwas approved in June 2024. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. The Army provided technical comments, which \nwe incorporated where appropriate.

      "text": "Army Program Type: MTA Common Name: HADES  \n \n \nPage 96 U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \n \n \nHADES Program \nProgram Performance \nThe Army initiated HADES as an MTA rapid prototyping effort \n(MTA 1) in December 2023. The Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology approved \nMTA 1 to develop the first two prototype aircraft to include \nfinalizing the design of the aircraft, ensuring adequate power \ndistribution, and integrating both legacy and newly developed \nsensors. HADES expects to initiate a second MTA effort (MTA \n2) in fiscal year 2026 for the development and production of a \nthird prototype aircraft. \nThe Army reported awarding a contract to the lead system \nintegrator in August 2024. Another offeror filed a bid protest \non this award in September 2024. GAO denied in part and \ndismissed in part the bid protest in December 2024 and work \nresumed in January 2025. According to Army officials, the bid \nprotest minimally affected the HADES schedule, and the \ndelivery dates for the first two prototypes remain the same. \nHADES plans to integrate four fully mature critical \ntechnologies for sensors and other military equipment in the \nfirst prototype aircraft. Officials stated that these \ntechnologies are derived from other Army programs. For the \nsecond prototype, the Army plans to integrate four additional \nmature critical technologies, including a new radar and \nsensors used for advanced signals intelligence. \nAnother critical technology identified by HADES is a digital \nbackbone. According to Army officials, the digital backbone is \na mature commercially available technology that implements \na fully integrated modular open systems architecture and will \nallow sensors to transmit data across the system on future \nprototypes. This technology is not a requirement for the first \nprototype. Army officials told us that the first HADES \nprototype was never intended to contain the digital backbone \nand it will be integrated starting with the second prototype. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nHADES officials reported plans to use elements of leading \nproduct development practices, including refining high-level \noperational needs into a minimum viable product and \nincorporating user feedback into decisions to prioritize \ncapabilities. We previously found that direct and continuous \nfeedback from potential users on product development \nefforts assists in delivering the most essential capabilities \nquickly and ensuring that the insertion of capabilities in the \nfuture meets the warfighters’ needs. HADES officials also said \nthat they intend to develop a digital twin but noted that work \non the digital twin will not occur until future iterations. The \nArmy stated that because HADES integrates predominately \nexisting capabilities into an existing civil aircraft, it plans for \ndigital representation to occur post-production. It added that \nit will utilize variations of digital twinning, such as a virtual \ncockpit to create training materials for soldiers’ use. We \npreviously found that a digital twin enables real-time \ncollaboration and allows for informed decision-making with \nstakeholders and users. \nHADES reported leveraging a modular open systems approach \nwith its digital backbone, which officials stated will allow the \nsystem to be rapidly updated to meet new requirements. \nOfficials also said that they are leveraging a modular approach \nwith a piece of fully mature hardware, called the canoe—a \nreconfigurable external housing for mission hardware and \nsoftware. The canoe is detachable from the aircraft so \nupdates can occur on the ground. According to Army officials, \nthis configuration will allow HADES to make changes to the \nsystem in a matter of months rather than years. \nCybersecurity \nHADES has yet to conduct any cyber exercises or assessments, \nbut officials reported that they determined what \ncybersecurity assessments will be performed for the first two \nprototypes. We previously found that early and regular \ndiscovery of system vulnerabilities makes it easier to fix them \nand reduces risk to schedule. \nOther Program Issues \nThe Army stated that HADES uses model-based systems \nengineering to supplement activities and that it plans to more \nfully integrate such efforts in the future. However, Army \nofficials also continue to identify the lack of a digital \nenvironment that HADES can use for system design and \ndevelopment as a challenge. HADES has a model that the \nprogram intends to use, but Army officials said that they have \nyet to use it and are working with Army digital environment \nofficials to publish it. This issue slows development timelines \nby limiting the amount of model-based systems engineering \nHADES can perform. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment for the Army’s review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated where appropriate. The Army stated that the \ngovernment team is forming a HADES modeling strategy with \nthe lead systems integrator, Sierra Nevada Corporation. \nAccording to the Army, the integrator’s HADES predecessor, \nATHENA-S, will provide lessons learned and risk reduction \nefforts for the HADES Prototype 1 design. The Army noted \nthat the HADES program intends to continually evolve its \nmodular open systems approach and plans to use Army \nProgram Executive Office Aviation’s enterprise architecture to \nthe extent possible. It added that, if any planned MOSA effort \nlacks maturity for the current system integration, the effort \nwill be considered for a later system integration once mature. \nAccording to the Army, the key enabler for this approach is \nthe digital backbone that will be first integrated into \nPrototype 2 and then into follow-on efforts."

Program officials \nstated that Phase 4, which will be completed in early calendar \nyear 2025, will be the final phase of developmental testing. \nThis will help inform the program’s planned transition to the \nmajor capability acquisition (MCA) pathway at production \nstart in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Program \nofficials stated that developmental testing is focused on \nlauncher capability and missile datalink integration within a \nsystem of systems. \nWe previously reported that the technical issues with one \nsubsystem were resolved but that the program would be \nunable to fully verify this until developmental testing. \nAlthough program officials reported no significant deficiencies \nidentified with this subsystem in testing, there are questions \nregarding whether the model used in testing is appropriate. \nWhile program officials indicated that they are confident the \nmodified model they are using is sufficient, an Office of the \nDirector, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) official \nstated that the model the Army used to test this subsystem \nhas not been accredited for the way in which the Army used \nit. In addition, this DOT&E official stated that changes to how \nthe Army planned to conduct elements of IFPC’s operational \nassessment raise the possibility that the testing was not truly \nrepresentative of real-world conditions. Given program \nofficials’ acknowledgement that IFPC’s testing schedule has \nlittle margin for error before transitioning to the MCA \npathway, any deficiencies or limitations identified during \ntesting could result in a delay to the program transitioning or \nrequire these issues to be resolved prior to production. Either \noption risks a delay to delivering capability to the warfighter. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nWe previously reported that IFPC is implementing limited \naspects of leading practices for product development, such as \ntaking steps to obtain user feedback as IFPC undergoes \ndevelopment. IFPC previously reported that program \nrequirements identified a specific materiel solution. This is \ncounter to our leading practices because development is \nfocused on compliance with fixed requirements rather than \ndemonstrated performance and user feedback. \nAdditionally, the program is not developing a minimum viable \nproduct that is consistent with an iterative approach to \ndevelopment. Instead, it is developing a minimum capability \nbased on an incremental approach. Future increments will \nfocus on providing additional capabilities. For example, the \nArmy plans to develop a second interceptor to counter \nadditional threats. Program officials stated that this second \ninterceptor would work with the IFPC system, minimizing the \nneed for additional development. \nAlthough program officials reported that the program has a \ndigital twin of the IFPC system, we instead found that IFPC is \nutilizing a hardware-in-the-loop system to conduct pre- and \npost-test analyses. This system is not a true digital twin \nbecause it is not a full digital representation of the physical \nsystem that feeds data into a digital thread. However, \nprogram officials describe it as coming as close to \nrepresenting the launcher and interceptor as physically \npossible while also modeling the sensor and mission control \nsystems. We previously found that digital twins can assist \ndevelopment teams in iterating on a system’s design to meet \nthe most important user needs. \nThe program reported that it is implementing one of the \nthree elements that leading practices call for in a modular \nopen systems approach—using modular system interfaces \nbetween major systems, major system components, and \nmodular systems. However, the program also reported that it \nis not incorporating two other elements of modularity that \nleading practices advocate. Program officials told us that only \none of the three elements is included based on the findings of \ntheir technology assessment. \nOther Program Issues \nProgram officials stated that several significant risks remain as \nthe program transitions to the MCA pathway. They noted \npotential issues with the supply chain and the lead times \nneeded to acquire parts for production. The officials stated \nthat they are confident these risks can be addressed but did \nnot provide specific information on planned mitigations. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated as appropriate. The Army stated that it \nsubmitted an updated requirements document in November \n2024 that did not identify specific materiel solutions. It also \nstated that the IFPC Inc 2 program is on track to complete the \nMTA rapid prototyping effort and rapidly developed and \ntested prototype weapon systems, which will inform fielding a \ncombat capability and proceeding to the MCA pathway at \nproduction start."

As part of this, the Army delayed production start for \nITEP to allow more time for integration with the Black Hawk \nand Apache platforms and discontinued development of the \nFuture Attack and Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). According \nto program officials, production start for ITEP, previously \nplanned for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, is now \ndelayed until the third quarter of fiscal year 2029. \nAs a result of the aviation investment rebalancing, the \nprogram reported that a stop work order was issued for \nApache platform integration efforts. According to program \nofficials, the reduction in fiscal year 2025 funding associated \nwith the rebalance required the program to change from a \nparallel to a sequential approach to integrating ITEP onto the \ntwo platforms. The program plans to complete integration, \ntesting, and qualification of the Black Hawk prior to \nproduction start, and the Apache after production start. The \nprogram plans to request funding to resume Apache \nintegration efforts in fiscal year 2030. \nAccording to the Army, it made progress toward ITEP engine \nqualification. It delivered engines to test facilities and initiated \nground testing for Black Hawk platforms as of the second \nquarter of fiscal year 2025 and expects flight testing on the \nBlack Hawk to begin in 2025. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nProgram officials reported that they are not using an iterative \ndevelopment approach and will deliver the full required \ncapability upon delivery of the first engines to the warfighter. \nHowever, we previously found that using an iterative \napproach could help the Army develop a system that delivers \nthe most critical capabilities needed in the near term and \ninform innovations for the next system. \nThe program currently employs some digital engineering tools \nbut not a digital twin or digital thread. The Army plans to \ndevelop an enterprise-level digital thread, officials reported. \nWe found that leading companies create virtual \nrepresentations of their physical products and a common \nsource for storing information to enable efficiencies during \ndevelopment, production, and sustainment. Program officials \nstated that, while the Army did not request model-based \nsystems engineering artifacts or digital engineering products \nat the time of contract award, the program heavily employs \ndigital engineering and analysis tools as well as modeling and \nsimulation in engine development.  \nThe Army is implementing a digital strategy that will enable an \nenterprise-level digital thread for aviation programs, noted \nofficials. The Army stated that the program’s digital \nengineering tools assist with design, manufacturing, and cost \nreduction. However, as we previously reported, digital twins \nand digital threads allow leading companies to take full \nadvantage of digital engineering efficiencies in those areas.  \nITEP is collecting end-user feedback during development from \npilots, aircraft maintainers, and supply personnel. This \nfeedback influenced the critical design review when soldier \nfeedback identified difficulty performing a maintenance task \nand influenced the design of the virtual interactive training \nengine, program officials noted. They reported that they are \nincorporating a modular open systems approach (MOSA) for \ninterfaces between the Black Hawk and Apache platforms and \nITEP. They cited some challenges with incorporating and \nadjusting to new MOSA guidance midway through the \nverification phase, such as the insertion of new requirements \nto demonstrate conformance. The program plans to complete \nincorporation of a MOSA prior to production start. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program completed one developmental cybersecurity \ntest in 2024, and one previously scheduled for 2024 is now \nplanned for 2026. Two operational cybersecurity tests \noriginally planned for 2026 are now planned for 2027 and \n2028. These delays could make it harder to address any issues \ndiscovered during testing. Our past work has shown that early \ndiscovery of vulnerabilities makes them easier to fix and \nreduces schedule risk. \nOther Program Issues \nThe program reported that total acquisition costs increased \nby 7 percent in the past year. Program oﬃcials noted that \nthese increases were caused in part by GE Aerospace failing \nto develop manufacturing and quality processes within \noriginally planned cost targets. Higher than expected turnover \nrates of contractor personnel and rework of engine hardware \nalso contributed to cost increases and hardware delays. The \nprogram reported that it is working on implementing cost \nsaving measures with GE. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated where appropriate. The Army stated that it \ncontinued progress toward preliminary flight rating testing, \nBlack Hawk platform integration, and ground testing. It also \nstated that the ITEP office is working with GE Aerospace to \nconduct formal schedule replanning in alignment with the \nArmy’s aviation rebalancing. According to the Army, the \nPresident’s Budget 2025 funding position presents funding \nand scheduling challenges.

      "text": "Army Program Type: MTA Common Name: IVAS  \n \n \nPage 102 U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \n \n \nIVAS Program \nProgram Performance \nOver the last year, the program continued rapid fielding of \n5,000 version 1.0 systems to the Army’s Training and Doctrine \nunits to inform improvements for version 1.2 in operational \nunits. According to officials, the Army began production of \n5,000 version 1.1 units in March 2024, incorporating a new \nlow-light sensor to improve image quality. It planned to field \nthe first 1.1 systems in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. \nHowever, the program reported a delay to this fielding to \nDecember 2024 after an explanatory statement moved the \nrequested funds from procurement to research, test, and \nevaluation. Both systems are expected to transition to \nsustainment upon completion of their deliveries. \nThe program also continued a rapid prototyping effort for \nversion 1.2 as the full -rate production model. As previously \nreported, version 1.2 is expected to increase reliability and \nhave an improved physical design. The program struggled \nwith soldier accept ance of initial versions due to reliability \nand wearability issues. It anticipates that version 1.2 will \nimprove acceptance.  \nAfter several delays, the program received a version 1.2 rapid \nprototyping budget review from the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of the Army-Cost and Economics (DASA-CE) in \nDecember 2023. The budget review indicated that program \noffice estimates were suitable to inform budget programming \ndecisions. But, since the program largely based estimates on \nsubject matter expert input and not actual data, a full review \ncould not be completed. The budget review recommended \nthat the program coordinate with the DASA-CE office to \ndevelop a better estimate for an expected version 1.2 rapid \nfielding effort. The program expects to complete this estimate \nby the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nAs we previously reported, the program used elements of \niterative development in its initial rapid prototyping effort as \nwell as in version 1.2 rapid prototyping. For example, the \nprogram conducts risk reviews and user assessments every 1 \nto 3 months. Officials said that the program conducted user \nassessments on the first two version 1.2 prototypes to ensure \nthe design will fix version 1.0 and 1.1 deficiencies. Participants \nnoted improvements but stated, “it’s not there yet.” Three \nadditional prototype builds and test events are scheduled, \nincluding a full operational demonstration in the third quarter \nof fiscal year 2025, after which the program anticipates a \nminimum viable product validation. Additionally, versions 1.0 \nand 1.1 will be fielded to training units to leverage lessons \nlearned in the design and fielding of version 1.2. \nThe program does not plan to use either digital twins or \ndigital threads, stating that developing them would not \nprovide future cost savings until a full-rate production \nbaseline hardware design is approved. The program will \nrevisit this after the full-rate production decision for version \n1.2 is made in third quarter of fiscal year 2025. We previously \nfound that digital twins allow companies to create virtual \nrepresentations of physical products to enable efficiencies \nduring the design-build-test phase of development. For \nexample, digital twins enable rapid iterative design cycles and \nfacilitate stakeholder and user feedback earlier. \nThe program stated that it used elements of a modular open \nsystems approach in the rapid fielding effort, including \nmodular design interfaces that comply with common \nstandards. However, the program did not use a system \narchitecture allowing major system components and modular \nsystems to be incrementally added, removed, or replaced \nover the platform’s life cycle. According to the program, the \nstate of technology at the start of version 1.2 prototyping did \nnot facilitate a modular design for major components within \nsize, weight, and power constraints. The program plans to use \nadditional modular open systems approach elements in \nversion 1.2 production. For example, it will include technical \ninsertions as requirements in future versions. We previously \nfound that leading companies design systems so components \ncan be added, removed, or replaced to update and improve \nproducts post delivery. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program received a cybersecurity certiﬁcation for version \n1.0 in October 2022. The Army stated that the IVAS program \ncompleted a cybersecurity strategy (CSS) but is not required \nto have it approved as an MTA program. According to the \nArmy, IVAS will achieve CSS approval when transitioning to a \nnew acquisition pathway, planned for the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal \nyear 2026. The program plans to obtain a CSS for future \nversions of IVAS. DOD’s policy for acquiring digital capabilities \nrequires MTA programs to develop a CSS customized to the \nunique characteristics and risks of the program. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment.

The Army missed \nits fielding goal due to integration and production quality \nissues discovered during testing that it has since resolved. The \nArmy conducted four tests in 2023 and 2024 that were not \ncompleted due to launcher, launch sequence, and missile \nproduction quality issues. These issues affected missile \ndeliveries as well. The Army reported putting a hold on the \ncompletion of the missiles for the first battery until a \nsuccessful end-to-end flight test verified the design worked.  \nThe Navy’s CPS program, which uses the same missile as the \nLRHW program and develops it for both programs, conducted \na successful end-to-end flight test in the third quarter of fiscal \nyear 2024. Our report includes a separate assessment of the \nCPS program. The Army reported lifting its hold on missile \nproduction after the successful Navy test and expects the \ndelivery of the eight missiles for the first battery to be \ncomplete within 11 months. In the first quarter of fiscal year \n2025, the Army also conducted a successful end-to-end \nmissile flight test—the first using its launch system.  \nThe estimated cost of fielding the first LRHW battery also \nincreased by $150 million since last year. According to the \nArmy, the cost growth was attributed to increases in the cost \nof the missiles and testing issues that resulted in \ninvestigations and retests. \nProgram officials stated that the second battery, which is part \nof the rapid fielding MTA effort, is on schedule to be fielded in \nthe fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026. This effort includes a \nmissile with minor modifications, which the Army plans to \nflight test for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \n2025. The Army also stated that the planned award date for \nbattery 3 ground support equipment slipped from the first \nquarter of fiscal year 2024 to the third quarter of fiscal year \n2025 due to funding delays. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe LRHW program is implementing some aspects of leading \npractices for product development. For example, program \nofficials stated that they developed the capabilities in the first \nbattery as the minimum viable product for the MTA effort and \nvalidated them in their recent flight test. Program officials \nalso said that they solicited extensive feedback from \noperators and maintainers during the design phase, including \nsome operators participating in LRHW flight tests, and that \nthe battery will accommodate successive updates. \nHowever, the LRHW program has only made limited use of \ndigital engineering tools. In July 2024, we reported that the \nprogram used some digital engineering tools to create a \nvirtual reality model of the launcher that users could interact \nwith to identify potential design flaws and challenges. \nHowever, it was not a high-fidelity, dynamic digital model \nnecessary for achieving the efficiencies associated with digital \ntwins. We recommended that the LRHW program assess \nimplementing digital engineering, including digital twins, and \nwhether to incorporate these tools. The Army stated that \nLRHW officials completed the assessment in December 2024 \nand provided it to the Army for review. Program officials told \nus that they do not see LRHW as a viable program for digital \ntwinning because the Army does not have plans to produce \nmore than three batteries. We previously reported that digital \ntwins are also useful for sustainment. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe LRHW program reported that software development is a \nmedium risk. Challenges, such as having adequate \ndevelopment hardware to support software integration \nefforts, contributed to this risk. The program also made fewer \nsoftware deliveries than planned. Program officials stated that \nthis is due, in part, to completing fewer tests than expected to \ngather software feedback and identify software issues. They \nexpect software deliveries to increase now that a successful \nflight test has occurred. \nThe program completed its first cybersecurity exercise in fiscal \nyear 2020 and plans for an additional exercise in fiscal year \n2025. The program reported that it expects to have an \napproved cybersecurity strategy in fiscal year 2025. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. The Army provided technical comments, which \nwe incorporated where appropriate. The Army stated that the \nLRHW program, in coordination with the Navy's CPS program, \nis committed to delivering this critical capability.

The program noted that the MOSA will allow for \nfive of the program’s subsystems to be upgraded in the \nfuture. We previously found that leading companies use \nmodularity—designing systems so components can be added, \nremoved, or replaced—to update and improve products after \ndelivery. By implementing the MOSA, the program may be \nable to upgrade its subsystems while minimizing disruption to \nits overall development. \nThe program stated that it is assembling technical data into a \nsystem architecture model to create a repository of \nengineering information accessible to stakeholders \nthroughout the program’s life cycle. However, the program \nalso stated that engineering data are transferred into the \nrepository via analysis and reporting. That aspect of the \nprogram’s approach differs from a key characteristic of a \ndigital thread—that is, data feeds into a digital thread in real-\ntime. Our prior work on leading product development \npractices shows that real-time data connect stakeholders and \nusers with information as soon as they become available and \nthat this better informs product decisions. \nM-SHORAD Inc 3 will develop a digital twin for several discrete \ncomponents of the NGSRI, but officials stated that they will \nnot develop a full system-level digital twin that operates in \nreal time due to funding constraints. Officials also said that \nthe launcher is mechanically stable, and its embedded \nsoftware will be tested as part of a missile simulation \nevaluation. Our leading practices found that digital twins at \nthe system level provide an enhanced opportunity to \nunderstand how fully integrated systems will perform. Due to \nthe lack of a complete digital thread and system-level digital \ntwin, the program may miss opportunities to take advantage \nof the efficiencies they can provide, such as anticipating \npotential design flaws, optimizing manufacturing, and \nreducing costs. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program’s contractors are developing software for the \nNGSRI’s guidance, navigation, and control system, and for the \ncommand and launch assembly. As a part of the competitive \neffort, each contractor is to deliver a complete prototype, \nincluding hardware and software. The program reported that \nits contracts did not require vendors to deliver software \nmetrics to the government. As a result, the program may not \nhave insight into the prototypes’ software development \nbefore delivery of the complete prototypes. The program \ndoes not have an approved cybersecurity strategy, but it plans \nto have one by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026. \nOther Program Issues \nOfficials noted that the program faces a potential reduction in \nfunding in fiscal year 2025. If that occurs, the program stated \nthat it will assess what needs to be delayed in this fiscal year. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment.

The program expects to enhance \nfuture batteries through technology insertion points, which \nare driven, in part, by requirement changes, soldier feedback, \nand mission needs. \nThe program, however, has neither documented nor initiated \nany of the remaining leading practices that our prior work \nfound could help deliver capability more quickly, such as \ndeveloping a full system-level digital twin or digital thread. We \npreviously found that digital engineering—specifically, digital \ntwins—allows leading companies to create virtual \nrepresentations of their physical products to enable \nefficiencies during the design-build-test phase of \ndevelopment. The MRC program stated that it is developing a \nfull system integration lab at Redstone Arsenal and expects to \nassess the feasibility of implementing a digital twin and digital \nthread by the end of fiscal year 2025. The program expects \nthe Navy to play a role in these decisions given the Army’s use \nof Navy hardware and software for the MRC system. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program previously reported that software development \nwas complete but has since clarified that it was referring to \nthe initial prototype battery developed prior to the current \nMTA effort. The program office stated that software \ndevelopment is ongoing to enhance capabilities, as well as to \nmitigate software issues found in the field for both MRC and \nthe Navy’s software baseline used by the Army for MRC.  \nSince our last assessment, the program scheduled a full \ncybersecurity assessment, which it expects to conduct during \nthe second half of fiscal year 2025. The Army expects the \noperational demonstration in 2026 to include a tabletop \nexercise with electronic warfare, cyber, and other threats, as \nwell as cyber survivability testing with adversarial and \ncooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. The Army provided technical comments, which \nwe incorporated as appropriate. The Army stated that its \nprototype MRC system was developed and delivered in record \ntime to meet Army and DOD mandates. According to the \nArmy, the program incorporated operational user feedback \nfrom initiation resulting in technology insertions to enhance \nperformance and address operational findings. It further \nstated that the program is pursuing upgrades to the Aegis \nWeapon System virtual twin, which is part of the system’s \ncommand and control architecture. While the program noted \nthat it acknowledges the benefits of our leading practices, the \nArmy also stated that those benefits would not be fully \nrealized prior to the completion of deliveries in fiscal year \n2027 due to the rapid nature of development. The Army \nadded that the program will continue to explore further \nimplementation of these practices during the operations and \nsustainment phase of the program."

It also began production qualification testing in \nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The program plans to \ncontinue testing through the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 \nto support a production start decision that fiscal year. \nThe Army reported delays to several milestones, including \ninitial operational testing, combined low-rate and full-rate \nproduction, and initial operational capability. Officials \nattributed these delays to manufacturing challenges related \nto defects with multiple missile hardware components, and \nthe associated root cause investigations and corrective \nactions. These revised dates place each of these four PrSM \nplanned milestones within 1 month of the milestones’ \nbaseline threshold dates. We previously reported that \nprograms with concurrent design and production phases, like \nPrSM, are at higher risk of cost growth and schedule delays. \nThe Army reported that it demonstrated the maturity of each \nof PrSM's seven critical technologies in an operational \nenvironment upon completion of its limited user test in the \nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The next technology \nmaturation event—that of the actual rather than prototype \nsystem—is planned for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 \nupon completion of production qualification testing. \nParallel to testing and technology maturation, the Army is \nproducing early operational quantities of PrSM Increment 1. \nOfficials said that they pursued this strategy to rapidly field an \nurgently required capability. Officials also stated that the \nprogram has delivered 26 early operational missiles to the \nwarfighter as of January 2025. \nThe PrSM program is also continuing development of its \nIncrement 2 design, which will incorporate seeker technology \ninto the PrSM baseline missile. The Army has been \ncooperatively developing Increment 2 alongside Australia \nsince 2021 and intends to deliver early capability missiles in \nfiscal year 2028. In fiscal year 2025, the Army intends to \ncontinue progress on Increment 2 by maturing the seeker, \npreparing for prototype test flights against maritime targets, \nand holding a preliminary design review. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe PrSM program reported that it is using some leading \npractices for product development, including input from \nstakeholders and a modular open systems approach. \nHowever, it is not fully implementing iterative efforts or \ndigital twinning in ways that we found lead to efficiencies. \n• The Army told us that it incorporated soldier feedback \nfrom a user touchpoint event early in the design phase \nand had plans to obtain soldier input for limited user \ntesting. The Army also told us it plans to incorporate \nmanufacturer or supplier feedback. \n• The Army stated that PrSM incorporates all elements of a \nmodular open system approach that allow components \nand modular systems to be incrementally added, \nremoved, or replaced. Program officials said that it was \nchallenging to implement a modular open system \napproach while delivering an early capability to meet \nArmy requirements. To overcome this concurrency, PrSM \nofficials reported that they urged contractors to complete \nchallenging elements of the design early, during the \ntechnology maturation phase of the program. \n• The program reported that it has an MVP for the first \nincrement. However, the Army set fixed requirements for \nall increments. Based on our ongoing work on Army long-\nrange fires, it is unclear to what extent the program will \nuse demonstrated achievements in Increment 1 to inform \nsubsequent increments. We previously found that \ndemonstrating an MVP—or capability—before starting the \nnext iteration allows companies to incorporate feedback \nand ensure that delivered capability meets user needs. \n• According to the Army, PrSM developed two digital \nmodels, including the program’s simulation of record, to \npredict and assess flight testing performance. While \nPrSM’s high-fidelity models incorporate elements of a \ndigital twin (virtual representations of physical products), \nthey do not integrate data automatically to mirror real-\ntime performance, which our prior work found is key for \nachieving efficiencies. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nAs we previously reported, the PrSM program office finalized \nits cybersecurity requirements after initial system design, \nrequiring updates that will cost about $200 million and take 5 \nyears. The Army told us that the program is implementing \nsoftware changes to meet the new requirements for \nIncrement 1 and plans to incorporate hardware changes for \nIncrement 2. According to the program, this approach \npreserves timelines for early fielding while providing full \ncybersecurity capabilities during full-rate production. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated where appropriate. The Army stated that it \ncontinues to procure the missile to meet requirements \nthrough early operational capability and plans to conduct a \nproduction start decision review in the third quarter of fiscal \nyear 2025, following initial operational test and evaluation. It \nstated that the results of this testing will be used to support a \nfull-rate production decision review."

Program officials said the delay resulted from both \ncontractors failing to develop MOSA-compliant software and \nhardware. Program officials stated that they assumed the \ncontractors had some degree of proficiency in using a models-\nbased engineering approach. Officials ultimately found that \nthe contractors lacked that experience. Building and maturing \nthe system architecture model resulted in significantly more \ngrowth in data and specifications than program officials \nanticipated. Program officials stated, however, that this \napproach has yielded a greater understanding of the vehicle \nthan they anticipated for a development contract. \nThe Army expects to identify XM30’s critical technologies in \nthe third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Identifying critical \ntechnologies this late in development risks XM30 not reaching \nmaturity before it transitions to the MCA pathway. Using \nimmature technologies further increases the risk of redesign. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe XM30 program—an Army-designated “pathfinder” \nprogram for pioneering the service’s digital engineering \nefforts—reported that it is incorporating some elements of \nleading product development practices. For example, \nprogram officials reported plans to develop a digital twin and \na digital thread. Officials said that while the program has a link \nbetween the model and the physical design, they are still \ndeveloping the full requirements for the digital twin and will \ninclude them in the contract for Phase 5. Program officials \nstated that they want a digital twin to also address \nmanufacturing and sustainment,  including the supply chain, \nwith a digital version of every vehicle to get real-time visibility \non sustainment. We previously found that leading companies \nuse digital twins to refine designs and optimize \nmanufacturing. \nAdditionally, as we reported last year, XM30 continues to \nincorporate stakeholder and end user feedback into the \nprototypes. The program held a soldier touchpoint with each \nvendor prototype in August 2024, focusing on maintenance \nand users’ interaction with physical models overlaid with \naugmented reality. According to the officials, users provided \nfeedback that resulted in the realignment of certain \nequipment to ease access for the maintainers.  \nAccording to program officials, the program identified an MVP \nas part of concept design during Phase 2. The officials stated \nthat the Phase 3 and 4 contract award would lead to a fielded \nMVP, and that they plan to add more capabilities to the \nsystem in the future, such as the ability to detect uncrewed \naerial systems.  \nHowever, the program also identified the refined XM30 \nrequirements as highly detailed to complete the capability \ndevelopment document and likely to be met by a specific \nmateriel solution—in which development is focused on \ncompliance with fixed requirements instead of on user \nfeedback and mission effect. In contrast, we previously found \nthat leading companies allow for requirements to evolve, and \nthat doing so helps ensure that the requirements are defined \nin concert with demonstrated achievement. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nXM30 is continuing software development in two parallel \nefforts—basic vehicle software and additive software using \nthe software acquisition pathway. The two prototype \ncontractors have been slow to use a government-provided \nDevSecOps environment to develop the basic software for the \nvehicle. As a result, the program identified risk to completing \nsoftware in time for developmental and operational testing. \nThe Army approved the execution phase of XM30’s software \npathway in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. During this \nphase, XM30 will analyze user needs to identify additive \ncapabilities, focusing on higher risk technical capabilities in \nparallel with development of the base XM30 platform. \nOther Program Issues \nXM30 is not conducting a full industrial base assessment. \nInstead, the program will conduct a production readiness \nreview during low-rate initial production with criteria that \nincludes identification of manufacturing sources and material \nshortages, following a standard process. Program officials \nconcede that there is some risk in conducting this assessment \nafter selecting a prototype for low-rate initial production. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the Army for review \nand comment. It provided technical comments, which we \nincorporated where appropriate. According to the Army, its \niterative approach refined capabilities over time—starting \nwith an initial capabilities document that identified high-level \ncapabilities; then an abbreviated capabilities document that \nenabled the Army and industry to iterate requirements based \non soldier feedback and early engineering analysis. It stated \nthat, during Phase 2 requirements refinement, it followed \nthose efforts with a more-defined capabilities document and \ndraft technical performance specifications, which it said \nhelped identify technically-achievable attributes and \nspecifications. The Army noted that continued soldier \nfeedback and analysis were used to finalize the capabilities \ndocument. It stated that this iterative, collaborative approach \nprovided the ability to balance risk for the Phases 3 and 4 \ncontract award and ensure that it did not direct high-risk \nrequirements on an unachievable schedule."

      "text": "Navy Program Type: MTA Common Name: CPS  \n \n \nPage 120 U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \n \n \nCPS Program \nProgram Performance \nDOD extended the CPS MTA rapid prototyping effort by 1 year \ndue to testing issues, but recent results have been more \npositive. In 2023 and 2024, the Army and Navy conducted \nfour tests that were not completed due to Army launcher and \nmissile production issues. After a series of technical reviews, \nthe Army and Navy conducted a successful end-to-end flight \ntest from a launch pad in mid-2024, followed by a successful \ntest using the Army’s launcher in December 2024. Program \nofficials stated they plan to conduct another flight test during \nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2025 from a Navy launcher \nthat mimics the launch method that will be used when the \nsystem is fielded on Zumwalt class destroyers. If successful, \nthis test will complete the MTA rapid prototyping effort. \nThe Army’s and Navy’s testing issues also caused the cost of \nthe MTA rapid prototyping effort to grow and delayed the \nfollow-on MTA rapid fielding effort. We could not determine \nthe total year-to-year cost growth due to changes in the CPS \nprogram’s cost estimating methodology. But, since our last \nassessment, the program added at least $284 million (fiscal \nyear 2025 constant dollars) in estimated costs to extend \ndesign and development and complete flight testing \nassociated with the MTA rapid prototyping effort. Since our \nlast assessment, the program also delayed the estimated \ncompletion of the MTA rapid fielding effort to put CPS on the \nZumwalt class destroyers by 2 years, to 2027. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe CPS program is implementing some aspects of leading \npractices for product development. For example, the program \nreported that it iteratively developed a minimum viable \nproduct. According to the program, it prioritizes capabilities \nbased on a technology insertion process informed by factors \nlike technology maturity, affordability, and evolving user \nneeds. For example, to reduce schedule risk, the program \nremoved some features from the first technology insertion \nthat were not essential to the Navy’s capability needs. \nThe CPS program also developed a digital engineering \nstrategy that included a digital twin and digital thread. But, \nprogram officials stated that neither will be fully implemented \ndue to time and budget constraints and program complexity. \nInstead, the program is in the process of implementing a \ndigital twin at the subsystem level, including a digital \nprototype of missile components and subsystems by 2027, \nbut will not establish a full digital twin of the system. Program \nofficials also stated they will not have a full digital thread, \nalthough the program does plan to improve digital integration \nof systems and link organizations supporting the program. We \npreviously found that these digital design tools are useful in \nthe design and validation process as they can enable more \nrapid iterative design cycles and facilitate stakeholder and \nuser feedback at earlier stages. Without them, the CPS \nprogram may take a longer time to make needed changes to \nfuture iterations of the weapon system. \nProgram officials noted that compressed time frames and a \nconstrained budget for the program led them to scale back \nimplementation of digital engineering practices, despite their \nrecognition of the potential benefits. They also stated that the \ncomplexity of the program and the difficulty in integrating \naround 30 activities at different levels of classification have \nbeen challenges. \nSoftware \nIn the past year, software development costs increased due \nto testing issues. Program officials stated that the increases \noccurred due to needing additional software builds to \nconduct additional, previously unplanned tests. \nOther Program Issues \nThe Army and Navy faced challenges in missile production \nquality and capacity that they are working to mitigate. After \nmissile production issues resulted in aborted Army tests, the \nCPS and Long Range Hypersonic Weapon System programs \nstated that they increased oversight of the prime contractor \nand the contractor was working to improve its work \ninstructions and quality assurance processes. CPS officials also \nstated that the Army and Navy had difficult conversations \nabout production prioritization as they try to balance Navy \ntesting needs and Army fielding goals. These officials stated \nthat the prime contractor plans to add equipment by March \n2025 to address a chokepoint in the production process \nrelated to the missile’s thermal protection system, which will \nincrease capacity.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. According to the \nCPS program office, following flight test challenges in fiscal \nyears 2023 and 2024, the Navy and Army program offices, \nwith their industry partners, initiated a series of design and \nproduction quality reviews and additional testing \nopportunities to achieve critical knowledge points and reduce \nrisk. The program office stated that the programs returned to \nthe range in 2024 and completed two successful end-to-end \nflight tests. It stated that it also completed CPS cold-gas eject \ndemonstrations. In fiscal year 2025, the program plans to \nconduct the first cold-gas launch of the hypersonic missile and \ninstall the CPS Weapons System onboard the USS Zumwalt. \nThe program stated that it continues to coordinate with the \nZumwalt class and Virginia class programs to support design, \ndevelopment, and testing in preparation for fielding CPS."

Changes to CVN 79’s delivery schedule that we previously reported \naccount for about half of this increase but the Navy is using funds it previously \nplanned and budgeted for post-delivery activities, so these are not new \nprogram costs. CVN 80 delays and cost increases for CVNs 81, 82, and 83, \namong other costs, account for the rest, according to program oﬃcials. \nConstruction challenges aﬀected CVN 79 and CVN 80 delivery schedules. \nContinuing delays to Advanced Weapons Elevators construction put CVN 79’s \nJuly 2025 delivery at risk, according to program oﬃcials. They said that, while \nthis construction improved since CVN 78, they may postpone noncritical work \nlike painting until after delivery to avoid delay. Further, the Navy now plans for \nCVN 80 delivery in May 2030, a 26-month delay since last year. Program oﬃcials \nattributed this delay to construction material availability and persistent shipyard \nworkforce issues that the program is working to mitigate with revised schedules \nand worker incentives. The program reported it has not assessed the carrier \nindustrial base for potential manufacturing risks but oﬃcials said that they plan \nto leverage other industrial base initiatives. This includes those related to \nsubmarines and within the Navy’s new Maritime Industrial Base program oﬃce.  \nThe program is assessing how to complete initial operational test and \nevaluation. The Navy began CVN 78’s operational testing in August 2022 but \nhad to deploy CVN 78 earlier, extending the test period to March 2025. Testing \nmay not be complete until ﬁscal year 2027 due to coordination of test events \nwith CVN 78’s next deployment.

Following live fire testing of \nthe Tomahawk missile systems on the DDG 1001 in January 2025, the Navy \ndeployed DDG 1001 before the ship enters a planned modernization period for \nCPS installation in mid-2026.  \nAccording to DDG 1000 officials, CPS program challenges resulted in a roughly \n24-month delay to the DDG 1000 live fire demonstration of the weapon system, \nwhich was previously scheduled for 2025. DDG 1000 program officials stated \nthat these developmental challenges do not affect their current installation of \nthe Large Missile Vertical Launch System for CPS on the lead ship. This is \nbecause the CPS program is responsible for ensuring that the hypersonic missile \nlaunches from the shipboard system. Still, key CPS technologies—including the \nmissile canister and system to eject the missile—remain immature. Such \nimmaturity poses design, cost, and schedule risks to achieving the DDG 1000 \nprogram’s hypersonic strike capability as planned. \nDDG 1000 officials noted that risk remains for CPS software and integration. \nThey said that the DDG 1000 program will use testing to assess integration risk \ninvolving software interfaces once the CPS program delivers a developmental \nversion of the advanced payload module that will hold the hypersonic missile \nand cannister.

Shortly thereafter in \nDecember 2024, the program awarded a cost-plus-incentive-\nfee contract for system development, test, and delivery of \nthree engineering development model aircraft, and options \nfor up to three system demonstration test articles and up to \nsix aircraft in the first production lot. The technical risks could \nnegatively affect the program’s cost and schedule and will \nchallenge the program to meet its mission if unresolved, \naccording to a September 2024 independent technical risk \nassessment. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nIn tandem with its goals to expedite development, testing, \nand deployment of capability, the E-130J program reported it \nplans to implement some leading product development \npractices. These practices include use of a modular open \nsystems approach and a digital thread that will include data \nfrom the system model. Yet, the program’s acquisition \nstrategy centers on a traditional linear development \napproach, which our work has shown greatly impedes \napplication of leading practices needed to develop and deliver \ninnovative capabilities faster. Further, the lack of an iterative \napproach will inherently impede rapid updates to the E-130J \ndesign should the program determine that changes are \nneeded to meet evolving user needs or to accommodate new \ntechnologies—undermining its modular open systems \napproach that allows for faster upgrades. \nNonetheless, the Navy continues to move forward using an \nantiquated development approach for E-130J, one of its \nnewest acquisition programs. The Navy’s premise is that it can \ndesign a system that will operate effectively for decades using \nlegacy technologies—even though history is littered with \nexamples of weapon systems retired prior to the end of their \nplanned service lives due to obsolescence. In support of this \naim, the Navy established highly detailed system capabilities \nand performance measures prior to E-130J development \nstart, curbing the program’s ability to refine capabilities \nduring design to ensure that it continues to meet user needs \nas development progresses. \nFurther fueling the development uncertainty, the program \nmade key decisions that constrain the system’s design and \nintroduce known technical risks. For example, the C-130J \naircraft—selected 4 years before E-130J’s development \nstart—may not meet operational availability requirements. \nThe E-130J’s technical risk assessment highlighted the \ncomplexity associated with integrating E-130J systems onto \nthis aircraft. The Navy’s technical risk assessment team \nexpects the integration risks to translate to manufacturing \nissues given the potential deviation from standard \ncomponents and the security environment required. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe E-130J program identified software development as a \nmedium risk, driven in part by changes to meet cybersecurity \nneeds. The program reported that the contractor will lead the \nAgile and DevSecOps approach to software development, \nexpected to start in April 2025. It stated that the goal is to \nhave constant communication with end users—pilots and \nback-end communication systems operators—throughout the \nsoftware development effort. According to the program \noffice, software development is following the major capability \nacquisition pathway as part of the E-130J platform and aligns \nwith software acquisition pathway concepts. Our prior work \nfound that requirements processes used by weapon programs \ndeveloping software outside of the software pathway \ngenerally do not incorporate Agile principles, risking \ndeveloping capabilities that may not reflect changing user \nneeds or threats. \nThe E-130J cybersecurity strategy was first approved in \nSeptember 2023, before development start. The program will \nbe among the Navy’s first to implement a Zero Trust strategy, \nwhich will require changes to existing avionics and mission \nsystems. E-130J reported that key performance parameters \naddress cybersecurity, and it plans to conduct a cybersecurity \nexercise and a cooperative vulnerability and penetration \nassessment. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \noffice stated that E-130J is an executable, accelerated \nprogram that integrates technology it considers mature into a \nproven aircraft, which it stated was chosen through an \nassessment of all available aircraft in production that \nconsidered many mission-related factors. The program office \nstated that it acknowledges technical risk but that, before it \nawarded the development contract, it executed risk reduction \ncontracts with subcontractors to address obsolescence and \nsize, weight, and power-cooling risks. According to the \nprogram office, it has a robust risk management plan to \nmitigate risk to acceptable levels."

More than 2 years after beginning \nlead ship construction, this persistent lack of design stability \nstalled construction of the lead ship and poses the same risk to \ninitial follow-on ships. The Navy currently plans to deliver the \nlead frigate in April 2029—3 years later than the original \ncontracted delivery date. The Navy and shipbuilder continue to \nrevise basic design documents, including the ship’s general \narrangement drawings—the design drawings that all other \ndesign aspects are based on—and structural components of \nthe ship. This approach is inconsistent with shipbuilding leading \npractices, which call for completion of basic and functional \ndesign activities prior to construction start. \nFurther, in response to a recommendation we made in our \nMay 2024 report, the program restructured its functional \ndesign metrics to more closely align with actual design \nprogress. As a result, the program concluded that its \nfunctional design progress is significantly less than the 92 \npercent complete it reported in August 2023. As of December \n2024, the program reported that the functional design was 70 \npercent complete, as measured with the restructured design \nmetrics. Although program officials expect to achieve a stable \nbasic and functional design by late spring 2025, the program \nhas yet to achieve its planned rate of design progress to meet \nthis goal. \nThe frigate design is further complicated by unanticipated \nweight growth. In October 2024, the Navy reported 759 \nmetric tons of weight growth from initial estimates—nearly a \n13 percent increase—due in part to the underestimation of \napplying Navy technical requirements to a foreign ship design. \nNavy personnel are working with the shipbuilder to reduce \nthe ship’s weight, but weight growth has only become more \npronounced over the last year as the program further \ndeveloped the frigate design. We previously reported that \nunplanned weight growth during ship construction can \ncompromise ship capabilities, as the fleet seeks to alter and \nimprove initial capabilities over the planned decades-long \nservice life of the ship. Such alterations may leave frigates less \ncombat capable, limit the ability to add capabilities to address \nevolving threats, and reduce planned service lives. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nIn May 2024, we reported that the frigate program employed \na traditional, linear development approach to acquisition, in \ncontrast to leading companies’ use of iterative design \napproaches centered on identifying a minimum viable \nproduct to quickly meet users’ needs. We recommended that \nthe Navy evaluate ways to incorporate these leading practices \ninto the frigate acquisition strategy prior to the acquisition of \nan 11th ship. The Navy stated that it is taking steps to \nimplement this recommendation. \nProgram officials stated that plans for a digital twin and digital \nthread will not be incorporated into program documentation \nuntil 2025. Officials stated that they have encountered \nchallenges with the availability of data, cost of data \nenvironments, and finding skilled personnel. Additionally, as \nwe reported in January 2025, the program’s documents \ncontain general language about MOSA principles but do not \naddress planning elements for modularity. \nOther Program Issues \nAs of November 2024, frigate program oﬃcials reported that \nthe shipbuilder had submitted a total of ﬁve requests for \nequitable adjustment, raising the potential of unbudgeted \nprogram cost growth, depending on the outcome. Requests \nfor equitable adjustment provide a remedy payable only \nwhen unforeseen or unintended circumstances, such as \ngovernment modiﬁcation of the contract, cause an increase in \ncontract performance costs. The Navy deemed the total costs \nof the ﬁve requests as not suitable for public release. \nAccording to program oﬃcials these requests relate to \ngovernment change orders and signiﬁcant design changes \nfrom the frigate’s parent ship design. \nDespite the unresolved issues identified above, the Navy has \nproceeded full steam ahead with the frigate program, \nexercising options for the fifth and six ships in May 2024. \nFurther, in November 2024, the Navy requested information \nseeking shipbuilders to serve as a second shipyard for \nconstructing future frigates. In January 2025, the Navy \nbegan assessing industry responses to inform future \nacquisition strategies.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program oﬃce \nfor review and comment. The program oﬃce provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. The program oﬃce stated that in early spring \n2025, it anticipates completing design products needed to \nsupport production. According to the program oﬃce, the \nNavy increased its leadership and technical presence at the \nshipyard, including contracted engineering support personnel. \nThe program oﬃce further noted that it continues to work \nwith the shipbuilder on frigate weight reduction and identiﬁed \npotential weight savings to regain service life allowance \nthrough a phased implementation across the ﬁrst three ships. \nAccording to the program oﬃce, the requests for equitable \nadjustment are currently under Navy review.

      "text": "Navy Program Type: MTA Common Name: HALO  \n \n \nPage 132 U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-25-107569  Weapon Systems Annual Assessment \n \n \nHALO Program \nProgram Performance \nThe HALO program’s accelerated plan to transition to the \nmajor capability acquisition pathway has been put on hold \ndue to budget concerns, according to program officials. Last \nyear, we reported that the HALO program revised its \nacquisition strategy to accelerate its transition to the major \ncapability acquisition pathway by 2 years to early fiscal year \n2025. The program eliminated its planned prototype flight \ntests—which can help reduce technical risks, among other \nbenefits—from the MTA as part of the strategy change. \nAccording to HALO officials, the program is now restructuring. \nThe Navy determined that offers it received for the system \ndevelopment contract were too costly given the program’s \nbudget. The program stated that it is reconsidering its \nplanned acquisition pathway as part of the restructuring.  \nBefore the HALO program’s plans were put on hold, it \ncompleted its preliminary design review in August 2024 as \nplanned. The preliminary design review included both MTA \ncontractors. According to program officials, both contractors’ \ndesigns were at the expected level of maturity and consistent \nwith the Navy’s performance requirements for the system. \nThe officials stated that there were no major design changes \nas a result of the review. The HALO program plans to select a \nsingle contractor to continue the effort. \nPrior to the transition to the major capability acquisition \npathway, the program also planned to complete an \nindependent cost estimate. The MTA cost estimate decreased \nby 20 percent since last year. This does not reflect a decrease \nin the expected costs for the entire HALO acquisition effort. \nAccording to program officials, the MTA cost decrease is due \nto the program transitioning to the major capability \nacquisition pathway in 2025 rather than 2027, as outlined in \nits original acquisition strategy.  \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe HALO program did not use an iterative approach for \ndevelopment for the MTA effort. We previously found that \nleading companies use iterative processes to design, validate, \nand deliver products with speed. Even though the HALO \nprogram stated that it was not using an iterative development \napproach, the program does use certain modern design tools. \nThese digital design tools are useful in the design and \nvalidation process as they can enable more rapid iterative \ndesign cycles and facilitate stakeholder and user feedback at \nearlier stages. Specifically, the program is establishing a single, \nintegrated, secure computing environment where vendors \ncan upload digital models of the components they plan to \ninclude in their design. These can then be assembled and \ntested as a digital prototype—also known as a digital twin. \nProgram officials said that the digital twin is a work in \nprogress and some of the models have been useful for \nexploratory design work. They also stated that securing \nsoftware licenses for the secure computing environment is a \nchallenge that they are still working to address. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe HALO program did not develop software as part of the \nrapid prototyping effort. The program plans to have an \napproved cybersecurity strategy before transitioning to the \nmajor capability acquisition pathway. \nOther Program Issues \nThe HALO program is working to better understand potential \nindustrial base risks before transitioning to the major \ncapability acquisition pathway. We previously reported on \nindustrial base risks for hypersonic programs, such as the \nlimited number of suppliers for critical components and long \nproduction times for components due to the processes used \nto manufacture them. The HALO program has yet to conduct \nan industrial base assessment, which can help identify \npotential manufacturing capacity and capability risks. \nAccording to program officials, the program engaged the two \nprime contractors to review and brief on the state of the \nindustrial base as part of the transition to the major capability \nacquisition pathway. These reviews identified issues similar to \nwhat other hypersonic programs have faced. Left \nunaddressed, these issues can limit production rates and \nmake systems more costly to produce. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. The HALO program stated that it has made \nsignificant advances in hypersonic technologies and \nmanufacturing capabilities under the MTA. According to the \nprogram, it reduced risks associated with Navy-specific \nimplementation of key propulsion technologies, specialty \nmaterials, and sensors while achieving important maturation \nmilestones on air vehicle design. Further, the program added \nthat an early manufacturing assessment provided a key \nopportunity to address and retire risks associated with \nproduction transition. It noted that, although HALO has not \nproceeded to the MCA pathway as planned, the lessons \nlearned through preliminary design and manufacturing \nassessment activities will prove invaluable in guiding the \nrevised acquisition strategy and eventual transition to \nproduction. The program stated that it will revalidate that its \nrequirements, available resources, and acquisition strategy \nare aligned and will update its engagement with the industrial \nbase, with the intent for HALO to enter an acquisition \npathway in fiscal year 2026."

In terms of cost, the program reported that it is  \ndeveloping a new estimate using stakeholders outside of the program office \nbecause the Navy often uses assumptions in its initial cost estimates that \nmay not apply to the LUSV. For example, officials told us that the Navy  \ntraditionally bases cost estimates on a ship’s weight, but the LUSV’s \nautomated systems will have different weights than manual systems due to \nthe need for mechanized controls.  \nIn 2024, the Navy reported that it successfully demonstrated the employment \nof robotic autonomous system prototypes during an exercise that ran from \nAugust 2023 to mid-January 2024.

Program officials stated that \ncontractors’ estimated costs to complete system development and testing were \nsignificantly higher than expected. The program received less development \nfunding than planned for in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 and the Navy included \nless development funding in its 5-year budget for the program. The program \nnow plans to focus on lethality improvements, while delaying more costly \nimprovements to the propulsion system. The program also plans to extend its \nschedule by 5 years and deliver initial capability improvements in 2031 or later. \nIn 2023, we reported that the program’s acquisition strategy had significant \nrisks, in part due to a compressed schedule. \nThe program also continues to have development delays. According to program \nofficials, the contractors’ deliveries of the hardware needed for testing is \ndelayed until mid fiscal year 2025 because of the length of time it takes for \ncontractors to acquire parts and components. The program also moved the \nstart of in-water tests, which are critical to discovering issues on torpedo \nprograms, from fiscal year 2024 to mid fiscal year 2026. \nThe MK 54 MOD 2 program still plans to use an iterative approach for \ndevelopment, but with fewer of the practices that leading companies employ. \nThe Navy uses a modular open systems approach for its torpedo programs, \nwhich makes it easier to add to capabilities and keep systems relevant longer. \nHowever, according to program officials, budget constraints have forced them \nto scale back plans for using digital engineering tools. We have found that \nefforts that do not fully utilize these tools may miss opportunities to anticipate \npotential design flaws, optimize manufacturing, and reduce costs. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment. It provided technical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. The program stated that the MK 54 MOD 2 addresses a critical gap \nin the Navy's weapon inventory related to challenging adversary submarines. It \nadded that parts and component delays across multiple weapon programs are a \nkey schedule driver. It stated that, to meet the operational need, it continues to \noptimize its development schedule and approach to supply challenges to field \nlethality upgrades as quickly as possible within funding constraints."

The program’s decision to delay the low -rate \ninitial production (LRIP) contract to September 2025, and its \nefforts to accelera te testing replacements for at least seven \ncomponents with obsolescence and other issues, \ncontributed to a significant increase in development costs \nsince our last report.  \nThe program plans to award the LRIP contract before it receives \nall of its production representative aircraft. Doing so risks \nconcurrency between developmental testing and the start of \nproduction, as well as cost increases and further delays if \nchanges are needed based on testing. The Navy requested \n$502 million in its fiscal year 2025 budget request to acquire \nthe first lot of LRIP aircraft—without receiving all the \ndevelopmental aircraft to inform the decision. We previously \nfound that procuring units before developmental testing is \ncomplete could result in future changes and costly delays. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported implementing multiple leading \npractices for product development, such as creating a digital \nthread that sustains authoritative data throughout the life of \nthe program. Our prior work found that digital twins and \nthreads provide real-time data to inform production decisions \nand could reduce the program’s concurrency risk. \nThe program reported having a documented plan to \nincorporate a modular open systems approach as part of its \nimaging and surveillance systems, which we found could help \naddress technology obsolescence issues to update products \nafter delivery. However, the program has yet to initiate the \nplan. Program officials told us that they mitigated all known \nobsolescence issues through low-rate initial production.  \nThe program stated that it tested a system-level integrated \nprototype of the MQ-25. According to the program, it \nconnected test data and operational learning from this \nprototype to a digital environment in order to test and validate \nthe MQ-25’s design in the carrier operational environment. It \nalso stated that a systems integration test lab includes a ground \ncontrol station interacting with MQ-25 representative \nhardware and software in a digital environment.  \nAdditionally, the program noted several other integration \nactivities that it said fed MQ-25 hardware and software \ndesign—for example, the prototype demonstrated aerial \nrefueling with aircraft, test results fed updates to flight \ncontrol designs, and performance data were incorporated \ninto MQ-25 development models. Our prior work on leading \nproduct development practices found that, by using rapid \ndigital design and test cycles, a leading company can model \nand simulate many more possibilities than with physical \nprototypes alone. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nProgram officials told us that system-level testing is underway \nfor the Block 5 software package, designed to support the \naircraft’s first flight and flight testing in the third quarter of \nfiscal year 2025. However, the program’s software costs \nincreased substantially since last year. Program officials \nattributed this increase to their 2021 decision to switch from \na government-furnished ground control station to one \nprovided by another contractor, which resulted in more \ncomplex integration with the Boeing aircraft than anticipated. \nProgram officials stated that they completed two \ncybersecurity assessments. The program does not plan to \ncomplete cyber testing until March 2026, 6 months after \nawarding the LRIP contract. By waiting to complete this \ntesting until after the start of production, the program risks \nincreased costs or delays to fix vulnerabilities. \nOther Program Issues \nThe program is assessing the strength of its industrial base \nafter identifying at least 12 critical components—such as wing \nstructure composites and other parts—that rely on a single \nsupplier. Reliance on a single supplier creates the risk of \npotential delays if the supplier experiences problems with \nproduction. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \nstated that the MQ-25 program is on track for production and \nfirst flight in 2025—backed by significant progress in software, \ndigital integration, and delivery of three vehicles. According to \nthe program, testing verified aircraft design stability with no \nstructural findings for production maturity. Additionally, the \nprogram stated that Block 5 software is in testing within an \nintegrated digital environment and that digitally-connected \ncapabilities enabled six successful integrated tests, carrier \nnetwork testing to simulated MQ-25 aircraft, and numerous \ncarrier landing simulations. The program noted that it is ready \nto deliver critical fleet capability with carrier-based refueling. \nIt also stated that it is addressing challenges in converting the \nMQ-25 prototype to production through efforts to make two \ndevelopment models production-ready and by mitigating \nindustrial base risks through supplier production reviews \nconcluding in spring 2025."

It noted that it is updating IFC-4 \nsoftware with corrections and added capability. \nProgram Essentials \nPrime contractor: Northrop Grumman \nContract type: Cost-sharing (development); FPI \n(procurement) \nCurrent Status \nThe Navy had deployed nine IFC-4 aircraft deployed as of early 2025. Aircraft \ndelivered to the fleet did not have a full radar suite and were not fully mission \ncapable. The program has mitigations in place to address radar availability and \nexpects to field all radar improvement initiatives by 2027. \nThe program extended operational testing by about a year since we reported in \n2024. According to the program, the added time is necessary to correct signals \nintelligence deficiencies. A DOD Operational Test and Evaluation official stated \nthat the program made progress in addressing significant deficiencies, but \nremaining deficiencies preclude operational testing. The official further stated \nthat MQ-4C’s operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability for primary \nmissions remain undemonstrated. \nThe Defense Contract Management Agency estimates that the next two \nretrofits of IFC-3 to IFC-4 aircraft, in 2025 and 2026, will cost a total of about \n$15 million more than planned. This is due to the potential for part failures \nresulting from the length of time that the IFC-3 aircraft were in storage. \nThe program reported no plans or budget for a digital twin or digital thread. It \nstated that it is assessing the viability of developing a digital twin to support \nintegration and retrofit of future capabilities. Given the anticipated content and \ncost of the second increment—a total cost of about $3 billion in fiscal year 2025 \ndollars—these digital engineering tools could save time, money, or both. We \npreviously found that not using such tools could mean missed opportunities to \nidentify potential design flaws, optimize manufacturing, and reduce costs. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for comment \nand incorporated its technical comments as appropriate. It stated that one \naircraft without a full radar suite is now fully mission capable and that the \nscope of work impacts the IFC -3 retrofit cost. The program added that it does \nnot have a requirement to develop a digital twin or thread; would assess their \nviability; and had not determined if such tools would benefit de sign, \nmanufacturing, or costs.

The Navy initially awarded a development contract in \nDecember 2020. Following multiple bid protests at GAO and \nthe United States Court of Federal Claims, the Navy \nterminated the original contract and reopened discussions \nwith the two companies that made offers for the original \ncontract. In August 2024, the Navy awarded a new \ndevelopment contract for the development of eight \noperational prototypes that will provide an initial capability. \nThe program plans to deliver these prototypes in fiscal year \n2029. The program reported that it is updating its schedule \nestimates to reflect the new development contract and will \nestablish a new program baseline by mid-2025. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe NGJ LB program is incorporating some practices that we \nfound companies employ to deliver innovative products \nrapidly, and it is considering whether to incorporate others. \nFor example, the program reported that it is in the process of \nidentifying a minimum viable product. However, it also \nreported that development is focused on meeting highly \ndetailed system requirements, which could limit its ability to \nrefine capabilities as user needs evolve. According to the \nprogram, it plans to complete this minimum viable product by \nthe end of 2028. We previously found that leading companies \nuse iterative design and testing to identify a minimum viable \nproduct, in turn ensuring that they deliver essential product \ncapabilities to users with speed. \nThe program also stated that it incorporated requirements for \na modular open systems approach into the NGJ LB \ndevelopment contract. We found that leading companies \nemploy modular design and manufacturing to combine and \nreuse common elements. This enables them to produce \nsystems at scale and keep systems relevant for longer. \nThe program is in the process of evaluating whether it will \ndevelop a digital twin. However, it is evaluating only \nwhether to develop a digital twin for the subsystem that \ndirectly controls the jammer, rather than for the whole \nsystem. Our prior work found  that leading companies build \nfully-integrated prototypes —incorporating data from both \nphysical models and digital twins —to test with users in the \nexpected operating environment. Testing of a fully -\nintegrated system can uncover problems that were not \napparent when subsystems were tested.  \nAccording to the program office, it is also creating, in effect, \na digital thread with model -based system engineering for \nend-to-end system views that will evolve over the life cycle \nof the system to incorporate real -time system \ndata. However, the program also reported that it had yet to \ndocument whether it will develop a digital thread adhering \nto leading product development practices. But, it has the \nopportunity to do so given the work that it stated is \nunderway on model -based system engineering. We \npreviously found that leading companies capture data from \niterative cycles in a digital thread, then use this information \nto inform decision -making, such as how to refine \nrequirements or change the product’s design.  \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe NGJ LB program is employing several modern software \ndevelopment practices, such as Agile and DevSecOps \napproaches, and also plans to employ several modern \nprocesses that the Defense Science Board previously \nrecommended. For example, the program reported plans to \ninclude the delivery of a minimum viable product for \nsoftware, continuous iterative software development, \niterative development training for program management and \nstaff, and software documentation provided to DOD at each \nproduction milestone. We will continue to monitor these \nefforts. The program stated that because it recently awarded \nthe development contract, it has yet to establish software \nmetrics or tools, such as sprint plans or product backlogs, to \nhelp determine the status of its software development. \nThe NGJ LB cybersecurity strategy was approved in July 2019, \nand the program plans to complete further cybersecurity \nassessments in the future. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It stated that NGJ LB is utilizing \nmonthly agile software sprints and a modular open systems \napproach design. The program office also stated that it is \nexploring the use of a digital twin to accelerate future \ndevelopment and sustainment, with potential to integrate \nmultiple programs into a common government-owned \nsoftware support activity."

With future \ndevelopment, the Navy may also use the XLUUV to carry and deploy \nvarious payload types. The Navy began developing the XLUUV in fiscal year \n2017. Its strategic plans state that the technologies developed as part of \nthe XLUUV effort will likely serve a key role in the future fleet by helping \nthe Navy field additional robotic autonomous systems. The XLUUV is \ncurrently a research and development effort. \n \n \n \n \nEstimated Cost and Quantities \n(ﬁscal year 2025 dollars in millions) \n \nThe Navy received the XLUUV test asset in December 2023. In \naddition, the Navy expects to receive ﬁve prototypes before the \nend of calendar year 2025. The Navy will test the received \nprototypes and, if successful, may elect to procure additional \nXLUUVs as part of a program of record. The Navy continues to \nevaluate potential procurement costs and quantities should it \nelect to transition XLUUV to a program of record. Estimated \nprocurement costs and quantities are yet to be determined. \n \nSoftware Development as of January 2025 \nApproach: Agile and Incremental \nSoftware cost and percentage of total acquisition \ncost (ﬁscal year 2025 dollars in millions): \nInformation not available \nPercentage of progress to meet current \nrequirements: 76–99% \nThe program reported software costs are not known as software \nis developed through the contractor’s own research and \ndevelopment funding. \n \nProgram Essentials \nPrime contractors: Lockheed Martin (design); \nBoeing (design and fabrication) \nContract type: CPFF, FPIF, FFP, CPIF \nCurrent Status \nThe XLUUV effort continues to experiment with and evaluate the test asset \nreceived in 2023 to gain knowledge on vehicle performance, and support \nmanufacturing and software development for the remaining prototypes. \nAs of January 2025, the Navy reported obligating over $400 million for the test \nasset and five prototype vehicles, which it expects to receive before the end of \n2025. This is at least a 3-month delay from last year’s assessment and several \nyears later than initially planned due to fabrication delays and ongoing battery \ndevelopment challenges. In January 2024, the Navy identified critical \ntechnologies for the XLUUV—such as autonomy, battery endurance, and \nnavigation—that have ongoing technical challenges requiring development and \nmitigation if the XLUUV is to meet performance requirements. The Navy plans \nto use less-capable battery technology for testing as it awaits Boeing’s \ndevelopment of the intended XLUUV battery. It also plans to begin operational \ntesting —needed to understand if the XLUUV meets mission requirements—\nconcurrently with acceptance of the five prototypes through fiscal year 2025. \nIt is now unclear whether the Navy will transition the XLUUV to a program of \nrecord because there are no clear requirements that the XLUUV can meet \nwithin current budget constraints, according to officials. Changes to XLUUV \npayloads to meet other requirements or capability gaps would require the Navy \nto pay the contractor to modify the XLUUV’s proprietary software, according to \nofficials. However, officials said that the modular design of XLUUV software and \npayload modules provides hardware flexibility and supports the potential for \nadopting an iterative approach. Should the Navy decide to transition to a \nprogram of record, an iterative approach could accelerate the Navy’s deliveries. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for comment and \nincorporated its technical comments as appropriate. It stated that the Navy is \nfocused on incorporating lessons learned into remaining vehicles; that in-water \ntesting helped identify and address technical risks to production; that the \nprogram continues to provide training, logistics, and replacement parts to the \nfleet; and that XLUUV will be ready for operations in fiscal year 2026.

These units are the technology \nthat converts electrical power for use on the craft’s electrical systems. \nAccording to program officials, the contractor could not produce spare parts at \nthe pace needed to repair the installed units. The cause of the reliability issues \nis unknown. These officials stated that a simplified part—the Electrical Power \nGeneration System (EPGS)—could replace the power inverter units, provide \nlower technical risk, and be developed more quickly and at lower cost. The SSC \nprogram installed and tested EPGS on LCAC 100 in November 2024. SSC \nprogram officials stated that they began installing EPGS on the remaining craft \nand conducting reliability testing in January 2025. \nIn general, SSC has suffered from some of the same issues as the Navy’s larger, \nmore complex ship programs, such as issues with supplier quality. The most \nrecent schedule slips are consistent with delays we have reported on for several \nyears. Specifically, the program delayed its IOC date in each of our annual \nassessments since its originally scheduled IOC in August 2020—a total delay of \nmore than 5 years. These delays also exceeded the schedule thresholds for both \ninitial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) and IOC outlined in the program \nbaseline, which the program is updating. As the program continues to delay key \nevents in its schedule, it continues to construct and deliver craft—with 25 craft \neither under construction or delivered to date.

As a result, the Navy is planning to update the \nacquisition program baseline by September 2025. The Navy is \nalso developing plans to meet a delivery date of October 2028 \nfor SSBN 826—a 12-month delay from the program’s contract \ndelivery date. However, the Navy estimated that delivery may \nbe delayed to as late as March 2029 if planned construction \nimprovements do not materialize. Moreover, we previously \nreported that the Navy lacked schedule insight that would \nbetter position the program to mitigate risks to achieving key \ndates, including independent analysis and data to easily \nvalidate the schedule’s quality. \nProgram officials stated that, while construction performance \nwas stable during much of 2024, it was not good enough to \nrecover from existing delays. The program attributed \nparticularly slow periods of construction to out-of-sequence \nwork that significantly disrupted planned construction events \nand led to large amounts of rework. According to program \nofficials, the out-of-sequence work resulted from missing \ninstructions in some design products that detail how to build \nthe submarine. For example, some areas of the submarine \nwere missing electrical work and holes for pipe installation. \nOfficials added that while the shipbuilders are taking steps to \ncorrect these design products, there remains a backlog of \ndesign changes that the shipbuilders need to address. This \ncould further affect the program’s schedule. \nIn an attempt to improve schedule performance, the program \nresequenced some work to optimize the order of construction \nevents. For example, delivery of the turbine generators—a \nmajor propulsion system component—is delayed over 2 years \ndue to design challenges. According to program officials, \nthese delays forced modifications to the order of work on the \nengine room, one of the submarine’s six large hull modules. \nOther resequencing involved moving selected work among \nshipyards to ensure the shipbuilders deliver modules as \nplanned. However, we previously reported that resequencing \ncan introduce additional schedule risks. Moreover, program \nofficials stated that the volume of work yet to be completed is \nsubstantial, and their ability to further optimize the schedule \nby resequencing it is limited. \nAccording to program officials, costs for SSBN 826 and the \nsecond submarine, SSBN 827, each significantly exceed their \nrespective cost to complete due to poor construction \nperformance, inflation, and higher material costs. Program \nofficials stated that increases in the total acquisition cost \nestimate from last year reflect inflation and higher labor and \nmaterial costs. Increases do not yet reflect recent \nconstruction trends. Officials stated that a future estimate will \nreflect higher costs due to further inflation and poor \nconstruction performance through July 2024. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported implementing some elements of \nleading product development practices. For example, it \nprovided high-level operational needs to stakeholders that \nwere subsequently refined prior to beginning detail design, \nand officials said that they incorporated end user feedback \nthroughout the design process. The program also reported \nimplementing a modular approach for certain architecture \nand software components. However, it reported no plans for \na digital twin of key subsystems or a digital thread. Our prior \nwork found that these tools are key to anticipating potential \ndesign flaws and incorporating changes. Program officials \nstated that a 3D model was developed for some of the \nsubmarine for use by the shipbuilders and maintainers. \nOther Program Issues \nThe program continues to face challenges across the \nsubmarine industrial base such as a lack of workers trained in \nthe necessary trades like welding and metal fabrication. There \nis also limited workforce and industrial capacity at suppliers \nthat manufacture Columbia class components. According to \nprogram officials, while the Navy is working to identify \nadditional suppliers to help increase capacity, it can take years \nfor potential suppliers to complete the qualification process. \nAfter more than a year of formal construction, SSBN 827 is \nabout 12 percent behind schedule. According to program \nofficials, material availability issues, among others, hindered \nconstruction progress. SSBN 827’s planned construction \nschedule is 4 months shorter than the lead submarine’s now-\nunachievable contract schedule, and the program will need to \nsignificantly accelerate construction to meet planned delivery. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. According to the \nprogram, the Columbia class remains positioned to provide \nthe capability needed to meet national strategic deterrence \nrequirements. The program stated that to reduce risk, it \nensured stable requirements, executed manufacturing \nreadiness and supplier base efforts, and continued cost \nreduction efforts. \nAccording to the program, the Navy continues to address \nindustrial base challenges with oversight, workforce \ndevelopment pipelines, and supplier development funding. \nThe program added that the Navy is pursuing additive \nmanufacturing, robotics, automation, and digital technologies \nto increase efficiency, capacity, and quality. It also stated that \nthe Navy is working to minimize SSBN 826 delays, mitigate the \neffect of late delivery on planned initial capability, and \nincorporate lessons learned for SSBN 827 and future \nsubmarine construction."

Block V \nis the most recent version to enter production and includes enhanced \nundersea acoustic improvements for its 10 submarines. The Navy also \nplans for the last nine Block V submarines to increase capacity for \nTomahawk cruise missiles by inserting the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), \na new midbody section that makes the submarines 30 percent larger. Block \nV starts with SSN 802, which includes acoustic improvements but not the \nVPM. The Navy plans to begin buying the next increment—Block VI—in \nfiscal year 2025.

The Navy has a \ngoal to deliver 2.3 submarines per year by the early 2030s. According to \nofficials, this increase is needed to meet the Australia-United Kingdom-United \nStates initiative under which Australia plans to acquire up to five conventionally \narmed VCSs. The shipbuilder’s work progress data show potential for further \ndeterioration of the construction rate due to inefficient shipyard work, slow \ngrowth in supplier production capacity, and prioritization of Columbia class \nsubmarine work, putting at risk the Navy’s ability to preserve its fleet size. \nConstruction continues to cost more than planned. Navy officials estimate Block \nV will require additional appropriations from Congress to pay for the \ngovernment’s share of estimated total cost growth as each submarine \napproaches delivery. They told us that cost increases influenced award of two \nplanned fiscal year 2024 VCSs. Construction costs are estimated to exceed the \nfunds Congress already appropriated, prompting the Navy to request a budget \nanomaly for an additional $5.7 billion, which Congress appropriated funds for in \nDecember 2024. Navy officials stated that $0.5 billion in wage increases \nincluded in the Navy’s budget anomaly request are one key to hiring and \nretaining skilled workers, which slowed construction progress.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment. It provided technical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. According to the program, 24 VCSs have been delivered with an \nadditional 14 under contract. The program also stated that VCS construction \nperformance is not meeting goals, and the program is not recovering as quickly \nas projected or needed. It added that actions are ongoing for hiring, reduction \nof attrition, workforce development, supplier base, production improvements, \nand continued investment to support achieving a generational workload \nincrease that would allow for construction of one Columbia class and two \nVirginia class submarines per year."

The Navy plans \nfor an average cost per ship of $506 million with $790 million \nplanned for the lead ship. This estimate from the Navy’s fiscal \nyear 2025 budget submission represents an over 80 percent \nincrease in lead ship cost from its initial estimate.  \nThe Navy planned to begin replacing the legacy ocean \nsurveillance ships in 2027, as they reach the end of their \nservice lives. Since the program exercised the lead ship \nconstruction option in May 2024, shortages in ship design \nresources and lags in receiving vendor furnished information \ndelayed contractor progress on the design. The shipbuilder is \nworking to develop a new schedule, which the program \nestimated would be available in mid-2025. The program has \nyet to set a date for the start of lead ship construction. \nOfficials stated that, as of October 2024, the functional design \nwas only 12 percent complete, far below the contract \nrequirement that it be 100 percent complete to start \nconstruction. Due to these delays, the program will likely miss \nits goal for fielding T-AGOS 25 in 2027 by several years. \nT-AGOS 25 ships will employ a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull \n(SWATH) design, where the ship’s upper portion sits on struts \nabove two submerged hulls. A SWATH ship that meets the \nprogram’s requirements for speed, seakeeping, and endurance \nhas never been built, making the design a significant risk for the \nprogram. Program officials told us that SWATH is an unusual \ndesign for Navy ships and is complex because it is weight \nsensitive; small changes in weight or displacement affect how \nthe ship sits in the water. They noted that keeping the weight in \nan acceptable margin imposes risk to schedule and cost, which \nwould be exacerbated by beginning construction work prior to \ncompleting the functional design. \nWe previously found that leading commercial shipbuilders \nlimit risk from unusual designs by setting and upholding \nexpectations that basic and functional design—including the \nship structure; routing of major distributive systems such as \nelectricity or water; and positioning of piping, ventilation, \nequipment, and other ship outfitting—be fully 3D modeled to \nachieve design stability before construction begins. In line \nwith leading ship design practices, the program currently \nrequires the contractor to complete functional design before \nthe start of construction and plans to complete the detail \ndesign of each design zone of the ship before beginning \nconstruction on that zone. However, the 3D model \nrequirements fall short of these leading practices. Specifically, \nthe Navy requires a minimum of 70 percent 3D-model \ncompletion and 3 months of production work packages prior \nto starting construction. Our previous work has shown that \nsetting design expectations that are below leading practices \ncontributes significant risk to cost and schedule. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nProgram officials told us that Military Sealift Command, which \noperates the ships, is involved in developing user \nrequirements, will be involved in design review, and will serve \nas an owner’s representative at the shipyard during \nconstruction. They also said that the program receives input \nfrom Military Sealift Command and the testing community \nand has regular meetings with the shipyard to incorporate \npotential improvements, consistent with leading practices to \nincorporate stakeholder feedback in product development. \nThe program also reported plans to incorporate a modular \nopen systems approach for its integrated bridge and the \nship’s navigation and maneuvering control systems. According \nto the program, its use of a 3D product model is consistent \nwith modern commercial and naval shipbuilding standards \nand best practices. However, it is not using a digital twin or \ndigital thread, which could ensure different systems and \nsubsystems work together to maximize modularity and the \nefficiency of design and construction of follow-on ships. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe T-AGOS 25 program is procuring, rather than developing, \nsoftware for the ship class. The program approved a \ncybersecurity strategy in May 2023.  \nOther Program Issues \nAustal USA is currently executing work for 12 new \nconstruction programs for Navy and Coast Guard ships, up \nfrom two programs in 2021. Resource and workforce demand \nfrom these other programs could impose cost and schedule \nrisks for the T-AGOS 25 program. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and incorporated its technical comments where \nappropriate. It stated that inflation increased initial cost \nestimates developed prior to 2020, and that the fiscal year \n2025 budget submission and acquisition program baseline \ncost estimates reflect contract award pricing. It also stated \nthat functional design is about 20 percent complete as of \nFebruary 2025 and that it continues work with the shipbuilder \nto resolve issues that delayed design efforts and to identify \nproblems early. It added that, upon the required 100 percent \ncompletion of the functional design and before authorizing \nthe start of construction, the Navy will conduct a review to \ndemonstrate that: (1) the design is sufficiently mature, (2) the \nflow of production information will support production, and \n(3) the status of material ordering and delivery will support \nthe proposed build schedule. In April 2025, DOD test officials \nstated that the program lengthened the time between design \nreviews and scheduled an early operational assessment and \nan internal business review during that time."

The \nnext seven ships are all tracking to deliver to the rebaselined schedule that we \npreviously reported.  \nIn September 2024, the program awarded a contract for eight ships using \nspecific authority granted by Congress. The Navy expects this contracting \napproach to save money over contracting for each ship individually. However, \nthere is still an increased average cost per ship because, per program officials, \nthe program is experiencing higher material pricing following the COVID-19 \npandemic and is allowing for a fair profit for the shipbuilder and suppliers. \nSome key events, such as Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, were delayed \nsince our last report.

The Site 2 contract, \nwhich the program awarded in August 2024, was limited by \nAir Force leadership to only working on preliminary design \nand software development until the Space Force approves the \nprogram to enter the MCA pathway production phase. This is \ntentatively scheduled for May 2025. \nFor Site 1, the program reported challenges in development \nof the systems integration lab—a simulation, testing, and \ndiagnostics facility—due to the contractor’s lack of expertise \nin building such a lab. In January 2025, the program stated \nthat the lab was complete and functional after external \nvendors provided additional on-site support. However, \naccording to the program, challenges with the lab caused a 7-\nmonth schedule delay. \nProgram officials acknowledged that Site 1 delays have \ncaused cascading delays to the construction of Sites 2 and 3. \nFor instance, the program delayed Site 2 construction start by \n9 months to April 2027 and deferred operational acceptance \nby 13 months to November 2029. Similarly, for Site 3, the \nprogram postponed both construction start and operational \nacceptance by 26 months, to September 2029 and January \n2032, respectively. According to these officials, the Site 2 and \nSite 3 delays are further compounded by anticipated future \ndecreases in program funding and cost growth on Site 1. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe DARC program reported taking several approaches in line \nwith leading practices for product development, but it is not \nfully implementing the elements of iterative development \nthat we found lead to efficiencies. For example, the program \nreported using an iterative approach to develop a minimum \nviable product (Site 1). However, it is not taking the important \nstep of fully demonstrating the minimum viable product for \nthe first iteration before moving forward with the next. The \nprogram stated that while Site 3 may incorporate changes \nbased on the results of testing from Site 1, the requirements \nfor Site 2 are currently closed for changes. The program said it \ncould use an engineering change proposal for Site 2 if needed. \nThe program also reported that it completed development of \na digital thread and started developing what it described as a \ndigital twin. However, while this twin will include some \ncomponents, the program does not plan to digitally twin the \nsystem as a whole. We previously found that leading \ncompanies use system-level digital twins to identify significant \ndifferences between expected and actual performance as well \nas gain insight into a system’s design that cannot be obtained \nphysically. We also found that digital twinning allows for \nfaster design iterations and can facilitate quick delivery of \nsuccessive minimum viable products. A system-level digital \ntwin could assist the program to more quickly design Sites 2 \nand 3, as well as future iterations of the system. \nThe program office stated that DARC incorporated a modular \nopen systems approach to allow for easy upgrades and third-\nparty development. According to the program office, a \nmodular open systems approach was incorporated into all \nmajor system components and associated interfaces. Officials \nsaid that antennas can be added to the array to increase \ncapability. Officials also stated that as Sites 2 and 3 \nincorporate new functionalities, Site 1 could be upgraded to \nthe same level of capability. \nCybersecurity \nThe program reported that it will conduct a cooperative \nvulnerability identification assessment in May 2025, 7 months \nlater than planned, after it deems the system integration lab \nmature enough for the cybersecurity inspection. \nOther Program Issues \nWe reported last year that the Space Force identified a high \nrisk between how the DARC system operates with a space \nsituational awareness data repository and a missile defense \nsystem program. Program officials reported that efforts to \nresolve system interoperability remain on track for planned \ncompletion in June 2025. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment.

The program is currently using NIO to \nsupport the first launch of Next Gen OPIR satellites, scheduled \nfor March 2026. It is using a multi-vendor approach for \ndeveloping the prototype software systems that comprise \nFORGE. The program stated that one of these vendors was \nawarded the contract for the second phase of development of \nFORGE Command and Control (FORGE C2) in February 2025. \nProgram officials expect to transition remaining development \nefforts to the software acquisition pathway at the end of the \nMTA effort in August 2025. \nThe ﬁrst operational acceptance demonstration of the FORGE \nframework was to initiate hosting of software applications \nwithin FORGE. The applications convey SBIRS data to users for \nbattlespace awareness and technical intelligence. After \nseveral months of delay, program oﬃcials reported the \nFORGE Operational Acceptance was completed in April 2024. \nThe FORGE framework demonstrated new capabilities and \nbackward compatibility with legacy SBIRS as well as delivered \nsome of its planned increased resilience and enhanced \nmission support. According to program oﬃcials, when the \nFORGE C2 capability is mature, it will replace NIO’s support of \nNext Gen OPIR GEO space vehicles. According to the program, \nNext Gen OPIR Polar vehicles, scheduled for ﬁrst launch late \n2028, will also be supported by FORGE C2. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe FORGE program reported that it implemented some \nleading product development practices. The program \nreported that it delivered the minimum viable product at the \nfirst Operational Acceptance and that it continues to develop \nsubsequent releases as it plans its transition to the software \npathway. According to program officials, FORGE initiated \ndevelopment of a digital twin with a full software suite \ndeployed on representative hardware. They stated that \nactivities on this suite rely on a mixture of automated and \nmanual processes, and that they have plans to add more \nautomation over the next year. Additionally, the program \nstated that it conducted testing of an integrated, fully digital \nprototype in a digital environment during 2024. Program \nofficials noted that testing is conducted at a facility that \nreplicates the operational hardware, infrastructure, and \nplatforms. We previously found that high-fidelity digital twins, \ncoupled with high-resolution simulations of the operating \nenvironment, can be used for testing a system to validate that \nit meets requirements. \nProgram officials reported that FORGE is colocated with the \noperator, and that the program works with this operations \nteam at least weekly to discuss software capabilities. When \nneeded, the program also works with this operations team \nduring test events to maintain close coordination between \ndevelopers and operators. We previously found that leading \ncompanies repeatedly obtain feedback from users to ensure \nthe product specifications meet user needs. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nProgram officials report continued plans to have contractors \nprovide major software deliveries three times per year, or \nsimilar frequency, utilizing Agile and DevSecOps principles. \nOfficials stated that a cybersecurity system vulnerability and \npenetration assessment was completed in September 2024 \nand the program received feedback from agencies and \nstakeholders on the completed cyber assessment report. The \nprogram held a cyber stand down event to work \ncollaboratively with cyber and FORGE subject matter experts \nto advance cyber configurations and implement changes to \nelevate FORGE’s cyber resilience, according to officials. \nOther Program Issues  \nProgram officials stated that funding was realigned from the \nEndurable-FORGE (E-FORGE) effort—a conceptual mobile \nground capability—due to pending results from the Space \nWarfighting Analysis Center Force Design study. According to \nofficials, the study was completed in December 2024 and \nprovided options to inform future improvements to missile \nwarning capabilities. Program officials indicated that no \ndecisions on an E-FORGE solution have been made at this time. \nDue to delays in hardware deliveries, officials indicated that \nthe second Operational Acceptance of FORGE within the OPIR \nBattlespace Awareness Center is delayed by approximately 6 \nmonths to June 2025. During this delay, program officials \nconducted a configuration change to newer server hardware \nand notified the Service Acquisition Executive of the change. \nThe broader FORGE program schedule will not be affected by \nthis delay, according to officials. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment.

The program reported that it successfully \nconcluded investigations on the technical challenges with the \nMDU’s timekeeping system and digital waveform generator \nthat we reported on last year. However, program officials \nreported that the projected delivery of the MDUs for the first \ntwo GPS IIIF satellites had been delayed to August 2025 and \nNovember 2025, respectively. The delays stemmed from \nissues discovered in acceptance testing of the MDU for the \nfirst GPS IIIF satellite. Space Force officials stated that the \nprogram has mitigations to prevent these shifts from causing \ndelays to projected satellite deliveries.  \nThe program reported continued risk reduction with the \nlinearized traveling wave tube amplifier (LTWTA) in 2024. The \nprogram reported that it had reduced risk, in part, through \ntesting LTWTAs for qualification purposes, beginning this year. \nTo maintain the satellite build schedule, the program will \ninstall flight LTWTAs onto GPS IIIF satellites prior to test \ncompletion for the qualification LTWTAs, officials noted. \nConsequently, if failures occur in the qualification testing, the \nprogram risks deinstallation and rework of the flight LTWTAs, \naccording to program officials. \nThe program also continued testing of its non-flight, system-\nlevel testbed, which includes all key GPS IIIF subsystems and \ncomponents. The program reported that it completed \nplanned risk reduction testing with the testbed, resulting in \nvalidation of the Regional Military Protection deployment \nmechanism’s design and performance. \nSpace Force officials stated the program is working to \nmitigate delays to projected GPS IIIF satellite deliveries. For \nexample, for flight components with delivery delays, non-\nflight components may be substituted for portions of testing. \nThey also stated that some subcontracted LTWTA deliveries \ncould precede the prime contractor-built LTWTAs, enabling \nearlier delivery for some satellites. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported that it is not implementing leading \nproduct development practices, such as incorporating user \nfeedback to prioritize capabilities or using digital twins and \ndigital threads to verify design performance. Oﬃcials said that \nthis is because development is focused on compliance with \nthe program’s deﬁned baseline, which does not allow for an \niterative development approach. We previously found that \nusing an iterative approach could help the Space Force \ndevelop a system that delivers the most critical capabilities in \nthe near term. It could also inform innovations for the next \nsystem to address less urgent needs. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nIn 2024, the program progressed with development of an \nMDU software update that will deliver some functionalities \nthat are required for the GPS IIIF satellites’ Regional Military \nProtection capability. The program reported that a software \nacceptance review for the new MDU software version is \nplanned for January 2025. \nProgram officials stated that in May 2024, the program \nsuccessfully completed an initial phase of its cyber \nvulnerability assessment of the GPS IIIF satellite using a GPS \nIIIF satellite simulator. In November 2024, program officials \nreported that the program completed a test readiness review \nfor an upcoming cyber vulnerability and penetration \nassessment, which will be carried out using the same satellite \nsimulator.  \nOther Program Issues \nLaunch and operation of GPS IIIF satellites depends on the \ndelivery of Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) \nBlock 3F. As of December 2024, the OCX Block 3F program \nreported that it is undergoing a schedule rebaseline due to \ncontractor Raytheon’s projected delays to the program’s final \nacquisition milestone—the predelivery integrated testing. The \nOCX Block 3F program reported experiencing delays due to \nthe extended diversion of Raytheon personnel to the delayed \nOCX Blocks 1 and 2 program—which we assessed separately \nin this report. The OCX Block 3F program reported that the \nfirst of the program’s planned capability deliveries—the \nlaunch and check-out capability for GPS IIIF satellites—is \nprojected to be delivered in January 2025. Delays to the OCX \nBlock 3F program could have corresponding effects on the \nSpace Force’s ability to launch and operate GPS IIIF satellites. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment.

According to the program, vendors \nneed more than the 5-year timeline to deliver a prototype \nthat meets requirements. The program plans to carry two \nvendors through fiscal year 2025 and proceed with at least \none vendor to completion of the software acquisition \npathway. The program stated that moving to the software \nacquisition pathway offered several advantages, including \nrequirements latitude and user/stakeholder involvement. \nAccording to the program, its ASIC technology is immature \ndue to factors that include the vendors’ underestimation of \nthe complexity of the development effort and late acquisition \nof key equipment and personnel. The program stated that \nmultiple technical solutions are in progress to address the \nASIC’s issues, and that these solutions have cost, schedule, \nand security risks associated with them. However, the \nprogram could not quantify the impacts, officials said, given \nthe ongoing trades among these three risk areas. \nProgram costs remain uncertain. The program noted that its \nIncrement 2 requirements are unchanged; however, it also \nstated that it is planning to modify the existing contracts’ \nscope and deliveries for the fifth year of the MTA effort and \nadd contract options for the software acquisition pathway \neffort. The program estimates that it will execute these \ncontract modifications in the second and third quarters of \nfiscal year 2025. Program officials stated that the program \ncontinues to prioritize schedule over cost to address the risk \nof MGUE Increment 1 ASIC obsolescence. They also stated \nthat future funding needs have yet to be approved. \nThe program office continues to track schedule as a risk. \nSeveral factors could impact schedule, including security \ncertification and the ASIC’s ability to meet performance \nmeasures. Current models indicate ASIC conformance with \npower and temperature requirements, the program said, but \nfull verification will not occur until formal qualification testing \nin 2027. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported that it is not using an iterative \ndevelopment approach for the MTA rapid prototyping effort \nand that its acquisition strategy for the effort does not call for \nuser feedback during design, verification, or validation. \nProgram officials noted that the vendors use a digital twin to \nevaluate basic ASIC functionality for the prototyping effort, \nbut that the program office does not have access to it and has \nno option on the contracts for obtaining it. Officials explained \nthat should the military departments—the ultimate users of \nthe MSI card—want access to the twin they would have to \nseparately contract for it. Officials also reported that a \nmodular open systems approach is not applicable to the \nprototyping effort because the receiver card is not a system. \nInstead, they stated that it is a component designed according \nto a government-defined standard for use with multiple \nweapon systems. \nAccording to the program, moving to the software acquisition \npathway will allow it to iteratively develop the receiver over 2 \nyears. During that time, the program plans to develop a \nminimum viable product, include multiple users and \nstakeholders in testing, and establish user agreements. The \nadjusted strategy aligns more closely with leading product \ndevelopment practices, which are focused on delivering \nmeaningful capability to the warfighter more quickly. We will \ncontinue to monitor these efforts. \nCybersecurity \nThe program previously reported that it expected to test its \ncybersecurity objectives during the operational \ndemonstration—which is planned for after the 5-year MTA \ntime frame. However, the program is now updating its \ncybersecurity strategy due to its planned transition to the \nsoftware acquisition pathway. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program oﬃce \nfor review and comment. The program stated that, in \ncalendar year 2024, it mitigated ASIC risk that would have \ncost the program approximately $100 million more and \ncaused a 2-year delay. It added that, as a resolution to \naddress ongoing schedule and cost challenges, it received Air \nForce approval to move from MTA rapid prototyping to the \nsoftware acquisition pathway after the MTA eﬀort completes. \nAccording to the program oﬃce, the handheld MTA eﬀort will \nuse early integration opportunities from the MGUE Increment \n2 software acquisition pathway eﬀort to achieve production \nreadiness by the end of the handheld’s MTA eﬀort in 2028. \nThe MGUE Increment 2 program stated that the handheld \nMTA eﬀort will achieve this readiness by maturing the design \nthrough MSI card integration, requirements veriﬁcation, and \noperational testing."

ULA \nconducted the first Vulcan certification test flight in January 2024 followed by \nthe second certification flight in October 2024. ULA and NSSL program \ncertification requires two successful test flights. The first Phase 2 Vulcan mission \nis scheduled for summer 2025, nearly 3 years later than originally planned. \nPhase 3 of the program’s acquisition strategy uses a “dual lane” approach with \ntwo contract types to assure DOD access to space. In Lane 1, providers compete \nfor approximately 30 less-demanding launches over a 5-year period to \nencourage competition and on-ramp new launch providers. In June 2024, the \nSpace Force reported awarding Phase 3 Lane 1 indefinite delivery/indefinite \nquantity contracts to SpaceX, ULA, and a new provider—Blue Origin. Blue \nOrigin’s launch vehicle conducted its first launch in January 2025. In Lane 2, the \nSpace Force will award contracts for launch services for approximately 54 \nlaunches to up to three certified providers able to meet the most demanding \nrequirements. Currently, only SpaceX’s Falcon launch vehicles are certified for \nDOD launches. The program expects Vulcan to be certified in early 2025 and is \ncurrently working with Blue Origin to certify its New Glenn launch vehicle. The \nSpace Force plans to award Phase 3 Lane 2 contracts in early 2025. \nThe program plans to acquire services for approximately 85 launches during \nPhase 3—a significant increase from the prior phase. This is due in part to \nDOD’s plans for constellations of large numbers of satellites in low-Earth orbit. \nTo address the increase, the program plans to invest $80 million to create \nadditional infrastructure for payload processing—the critical stage in which \nsatellites are encapsulated in the protective nosecone before transport to the \nlaunch pad. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for comment and \nincorporated its technical comments as appropriate. The program stated that \nNSSL provides resilient, responsive launch services that secure the nation’s \naccess to space; launches of the last Delta IV and Atlas V in 2024 ended reliance \non Russian engines; it increased launch providers by adding the New Glenn \nvehicle; and it launched a GPS satellite only 7 months from contract award."

The delays resulted in pushing the \nexpected delivery of the program to June 2025, an additional \n9-month delay since last year’s reported estimate.\nThe program expects to complete a series of required \ntesting and development milestones prior to the delivery of \nOCX Blocks 1 and 2. One of these milestones is site \nacceptance testing, which DOD development test officials \nexpect to be completed in March 20 25—a 6-month delay \nsince last year’s estimate. DOD test officials cited air \nconditioning failure at one of the site acceptance test sites \nand funding gaps as reasons for recent program delays. \nAccording to program officials, the contractor completed \ntechnical orders and certifications necessary to support \noperator training in September 2024— another milestone \nrequired before delivery.  \nThe program is continuing to address a backlog of critical \ndeficiencies throughout testing. Test officials noted that, as of \nDecember 2024, the OCX program has 102 open deficiencies \nrelated to site acceptance testing requirements, 39 related to \nsimulators and testing systems, and 129 directly related to \ndevelopmental testing. According to defense development \ntest officials, the program reported a decrease in reported \ndeficiencies that will allow it to reduce the backlog, though \nnew deficiencies will continue to be identified when new \ntesting starts. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe OCX program reported some implementation of leading \nproduct development practices. It is implementing a modular \nopen systems approach with hardware that uses modular \ncommercial-off-the-shelf components, according to the \nprogram office. \nAccording to the program, it has been incorporating \nfeedback from stakeholders and end users —including DOD’s \nmilitary departments, civilian agencies such as the Federal \nAviation Administration, and the broader GPS -user base of \ncommercial airline pilots —during design, verification, and \nvalidation. However, according to the program, OCX is not \ndeveloping a minimal viable product that incorporates user \nfeedback and prioritizes capabilities because the program \nwas given specific performance parameters identifie d in \npreviously established requirements.  \nThe program reported that it does not plan to develop a \ndigital twin or digital thread for OCX. According to program \nofficials, implementing these digital tools at this point would \nbe cost prohibitive. The officials stated that the program \ndeveloped a partial twin of the GPS constellation through a \nsystem simulator, which they noted allows the program to \ntest requirements and resolve anomalies. \nThe program reported that it changed from a linear to an \niterative approach in 2017 due to poor performance and design \nfailures that led to rework. By not fully adopting the leading \npractices that facilitate an iterative solution—such as refining \nrequirements and prioritizing capabilities to ensure they meet \nuser needs—the program is at risk of similar outcomes. \nCybersecurity \nProgram documents indicated that the program plans to \nconduct a series of cybersecurity tests in 2025, but like other \nmilestone dates, they have been delayed. For example, the \nprogram’s adversarial assessment is now scheduled for \nDecember 2025, 12 months later than reported last year. \nDOD developmental testing officials noted that deferring \ncybersecurity testing represents a risk to the program \nachieving initial operational capability. \nOther Program Issues \nIn November 2024, DOD announced a $196.7 million \nmodification to Raytheon’s OCX development contract. \nAccording to program officials, the modification will support \ntesting of OCX Blocks 1 and 2 after delivery to operations, as \nwell as address remaining deficiencies.\n \nDefense testing officials noted that the prioritization of \nresources to support OCX Blocks 1 and 2 is continuing to \naffect development of the next iteration of the system, OCX \n3F, which is necessary to launch and support the GPS IIIF \nsatellites currently in development. Officials reported that \nOCX 3F is now undergoing a rebaseline due to delays. We \ndiscuss the effect of these delays to GPS IIIF satellites in a \nseparate assessment.\n \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment.  \nThe program office stated that OCX is progressing through \ntesting and transition events and uniformed operators \nsuccessfully commanded GPS satellites with the OCX \nsystem. The program stated that this resulted in the first \nbroadcast of an OCX -generated navi gation signal from a \nGPS satellite. The program office also stated that it is \ncontinuing to test daily and is working with Raytheon to \naddress any lingering deficiencies and outstanding \nrequirements. According to the program office, it expects \nOCX Blocks 1 and 2 to achieve initial capability in the third \nquarter of fiscal year 2025 and operational acceptance in \nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2026."

The approval \nfollowed a decision to reduce the constellation from three \nsatellites to two satellites. Program oﬃcials told us that \ncontinued positive performance of the SBIRS constellation \nand the strategic pivot to conduct missile tracking from other \norbits drove the decision. Oﬃcials reported that this decision \nwould not result in a coverage gap due to the ﬁrst GEO \nsatellite’s planned delivery in 2025. \nIn September 2024, program oﬃcials reported successful \ncompletion of the thermal vacuum testing on the mission \npayload, a critical milestone for the program. Thermal vacuum \ntesting simulates the space environment to determine if the \narticle under test will perform in its intended environment. \nThe program oﬃce reported that the payload was installed on \nthe space vehicle in September 2024 and scheduled complete \nend-to-end testing in December 2024. \nDespite recent successes, the program continues to face \nschedule challenges, driven largely by the mission payload. \nProgram oﬃcials reported the mission payload was delivered \nin August 2024, after a 13-month delay. As a result, the \nprogram has no buﬀer in its schedule to ﬁrst launch; any \npayload and space vehicle integration delays will likely result \nin launch delays and program cost increases. Additionally, the \nrecently approved acquisition program baseline asserts that \nthe program contract schedule is aggressive, and that it has \noverall high risk in meeting all program objectives for an initial \nlaunch capability in ﬁscal year 2025 due to mission capability \nand system development and integration risks. A launch delay \nof at least a year is likely for the ﬁrst GEO satellite, as we \nreported in 2024. \nIn February 2025, after our cutoﬀ date for new information, \nthe program reported that the satellite will be delivered as \nplanned in September 2025, but due to a crowded 2025 \nlaunch manifest, Next Gen OPIR GEO will be launched no \nearlier than March 2026. This launch determination was made \nby the Space Force’s launch program oﬃce. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nContrary to what the program reported last year, we \ndetermined that the program is not following iterative \ndevelopment. Instead, it is using a more traditional acquisition \napproach, wherein it identifies highly detailed system \nrequirements likely to be met by a specific materiel solution. \nAdditionally, while the program stated that it identified a \nminimum viable product as part of its approach, that product \nincorporates only three of the four elements that leading \npractices define as necessary to establish a minimum viable \nproduct. It does not include the fourth element—prioritize \ncapabilities that can be fielded to meet user needs. Without \nthis element, we do not consider the product that the \nprogram identified to be a minimum viable product. \nThe program stated that it completed development of a \ndigital thread, which will support several activities, including \nrequirements analysis, design evaluation, integration, testing, \nand support and sustainment. The program added that it \nencountered challenges in developing the thread, such as \nidentifying the necessary components to validate, implement, \nand execute system integration. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nThe program oﬃce reported that it is using a contractor-led \napproach for software development, since the prime \ncontractor has the subject matter expertise to leverage the \nheritage SBIRS software baseline. The program also noted \nthat a subcontractor—with robust software development \nexperience and experience developing the complete mission \npayload systems—is developing the payload software. \nThe program plans to conduct a key cybersecurity task, \ncooperative vulnerability identiﬁcation, in 2025—after the \nstart of operational testing. This may result in late discovery of \nsystem vulnerabilities that require more diﬃcult remediation, \nwhich could have a negative eﬀect on cost, schedule, and \nperformance.\n \nProgram Oﬃce Comments  \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program \noffice for review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate.  \nIt stated that it is demonstrating execution in speed of \nacquisitions and is primed to deliver two satellites capable of \ndetecting advanced adversary missiles to ensure sustained \noperations in contested environments. The program also \nnoted that it continues to mitigate technical and cost risks. It \nalso stated that it frequently engages with the operational \ncommunity to understand their priorities for minimally viable \ncapabilities that can be fielded most quickly. According to the \nprogram, this understanding ensures the right capability is \ndelivered when needed and at the right value. The program \nadded that it is on track to deliver in half the time it took to \ndeliver its predecessor SBIRS program, which it considers a \ntestament to its proactive approach, collaborative \npartnerships, and adaptability."

For example, the program stated that for a \nsatellite system, a minimum viable product is not suitable to \nbe fielded to an operational environment, and that these \nsatellites are launched with hardware and software that \ndeliver planned capability. However, we previously found that \nimplementing an iterative structure could result in better \nprogram outcomes and efficiencies for satellite programs by \nusing digital tools to prioritize the most essential capabilities \nwith users and adding iterative functionality, such as through \nsoftware updates. \nProgram officials told us the program is engaging with users \nand stakeholders regularly during design, development, \nintegration, and test to solicit feedback. They added that \nthese forums include working groups, technical exchange \nmeetings, and user engagement discussions. Officials also \nindicated that design modifications have been approved and \ndocumented based on these engagement forums. We \npreviously found that direct and continuous feedback from \npotential users on product development efforts assists \ndevelopers in prioritizing and delivering the most essential \ncapabilities quickly. \nWe also found that leading companies use modern tools such \nas digital twins and digital threads to simulate potential \noperating scenarios and build confidence that the products \nwill work when produced. According to the program, it \ninitiated development of portions of a digital thread and plans \nto further develop the thread in the future. The program, \nhowever, stated that additional modeling and digital twins \nwould add unnecessary cost, as the program’s foundation is \nbuilt on successfully integrating heritage technology and \nengineering design units. \nCybersecurity \nIn July 2024, the Space Force finalized the program’s \ncybersecurity strategy. The program expects to conduct at \nleast two more tests during 2025, followed by a full system \nassessment in 2027. \nThe program reported that it intends to use “continuous \nauthorization to operate” for the space vehicles and ground \nsegments. This is a modernized authorization approach that \nhelps organizations maintain security and compliance for their \ninformation systems. A system with a continuous authorization \nto operate has demonstrated sufficient maturity in its ability to \nmaintain a resilient cybersecurity posture so that traditional risk \nassessments and authorizations become redundant. \nOther Program Issues \nNext Gen OPIR Polar will rely on a related MTA ground system \ncalled FORGE, which we assess separately in this report. \nSpecifically, command and control and mission data \nprocessing functions will reside in the FORGE program for \nNext Gen OPIR Polar. FORGE must successfully complete \nmultiple development, integration, and test steps before it \nwill be ready for system-level testing. Additionally, the Next \nGen OPIR Polar program is leveraging the main mission \npayload from a separate MTA effort called Next Gen OPIR \nGEO, which we also assess in this report. The payload will \nneed to be modified to some extent to operate in the polar \norbit. If the modified payload experiences issues integrating \nonto the Next Gen OPIR Polar space vehicle, or if the FORGE \nsystem lacks sufficient maturity by the end of fiscal year 2026, \nNext Gen OPIR Polar is likely to experience schedule delays \nand cost growth. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. The program office provided \ntechnical comments, which we incorporated where \nappropriate. The program office stated that it is primed to \ndeliver two Next Gen OPIR Polar missile warning and tracking \nsatellites capable of detecting advanced adversary missiles \nover the northern hemisphere and of ensuring operations in \ncontested environments. The program added that it \ncontinues to mitigate technical and cost risks and frequently \nengages with the operational community to understand its \npriorities for minimally viable capabilities that can be fielded \nmost quickly. This understanding, it stated, ensures the right \ncapability is delivered when needed and at the right value. \nThe program added that it is on track to deliver its first \nsatellite in 2028."

Under the MTA rapid prototyping effort, \nPTS-P matured all critical technologies and performed risk \nreduction efforts for PTS-R. According to program officials, \nthey will demonstrate and test the capabilities of the \nprototypes on orbit to ensure they operate as expected and \ncan communicate with ground terminals. In addition, officials \nnoted that they intend to use the prototypes as test and \ntraining assets and to provide residual operational capability. \nThe program decided to launch and test PTS-P prototypes as \nstand-alone assets rather than conduct testing in a digital \nenvironment. Program officials stated that, if the prototype \ndemonstrations were successful, they could pivot the \nprototypes into on-orbit capabilities. Officials said that the \nprototypes have a 5-year design life and will be used to \nconduct residual operations. \nPTS-R officials said that the program completed security \nverification testing of the program’s cryptographic unit, a \ncritical technology. These officials told us that final \ncertification of these units is scheduled for March 2025 and \nthat certification must be achieved by the scheduled \nNovember 2025 launch of the first prototype. \nPTS-R officials said that on-orbit testing for the PTS-P \nprototypes has been delayed to 2026. Previously, we reported \nthat the first test flight for the program was scheduled for \nApril 2025 with on-orbit testing and demonstration scheduled \nfor October 2025. PTS-R officials stated that launch and the \nfirst test flight of the prototypes are now scheduled for \nNovember 2025 and January 2026, respectively. Officials \nnoted that the planned dates slipped due to a delay resulting \nfrom the number of planned launches. Both prototypes will \nbe launched on Vulcan rockets, which have experienced \ncertification delays. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nThe program reported that it incorporated some leading \nproduct development practices. For example, it said that it \nobtained user feedback during quarterly test team meetings \nand during PTS-P prototype demonstrations, preliminary \ndesign review, and critical design review. In addition, it \nexpects to collect user feedback during on-orbit testing of the \nprototypes—intended to provide fielded on-orbit operational \ncapability—and incorporate that feedback into the PTS-R \nsatellites that the program plans to develop on the major \ncapability acquisition pathway. However, the program did not \nreport that the prototypes include a key element—prioritize \ncapabilities that can be fielded most quickly to meet user \nneeds. Without this element, we do not consider the product \nthat the program identified to be a minimum viable product. \nThe program reported that requirements for the follow-on \nsatellite will already be set prior to prototype demonstrations, \nwhich limits the program’s ability to refine requirements as \nuser needs evolve. Rather than fixing requirements before the \nstart of design, leading companies use digital twins—virtual \nrepresentations of a physical system—to test the \nperformance of different designs and prioritize the most \nessential capabilities. PTS-R officials said that PTS-P \ndevelopment did not require a digital twin for technology \nmaturation, but that they will evaluate the efficacy of that \napproach during source selection for the upcoming PTS-R \ncontract. Officials noted that some digital models were used \non PTS-P to model the performance aspect of prototype \ndesigns. According to the program, the models were not \ndigital twins but gave it assurance that the prototypes could \nperform on orbit. We previously found that digital design \ntools, such as digital twins and digital threads, can enable \nrapid iterative design cycles and inform decision-making, such \nas how to refine requirements for future cycles. \nOther Program Issues \nAccording to program officials, PTS-R is conducting a limited \ncompetition between the two prototype vendors and plans to \naward the contract roughly 9 months later than previously \nanticipated. According to program officials, the program’s \nacquisition strategy was amended to move PTS-R’s transition \nto the technology maturation and risk reduction phase rather \nthan engineering and manufacturing design. They stated that \nthis allows the program to complete all required \ndocumentation, such as an acquisition program baseline. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \noffice stated that both prototypes continue to progress \nthrough integration and testing to support launch and the \nstart of on-orbit demonstrations. The program office noted \nthat extensive ground testing and demonstrations conducted \nduring rapid prototyping have shown system requirements \nare achievable with the technologies developed. Further, it \nadded that on-orbit testing of the prototypes will continue to \nenable iteration of key elements to be used in operation of \nthe PTS-R system. According to the program office, contract \naward for the PTS-R program remains on track for an award in \nthe second quarter of 2025."

Program officials said that in June 2024, the \nprogram terminated its contract with Raytheon, a prime \ncontractor for three satellites, due to cost and schedule \ngrowth. However, program officials stated that Epoch 1 \nincreased from six to 12 satellites due to cost savings realized \nfrom terminating the Raytheon contract and adding six less-\nexpensive satellites from Millenium Space Systems with a \nsmaller payload.

Program officials said that this is no \nlonger an issue, as stakeholders have obtained the needed \ninformation through other means. \nProgram officials stated that Epoch 1 has requirements for \nthe system to be modular and use common interfaces and \nstandards. For example, the program uses a published \nstandard tracking data format used by the Overhead \nPersistent Infrared community. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nSoftware development for the Resilient MW/MT MEO \nprogram, including the Epoch 1 satellites and ground \nsegment, is part of a missile warning and tracking enterprise \neffort.

The program said it plans to launch in \nJune 2025—a 2-month delay from its baseline date. SDA said \nthat to avoid further delays, it is working with the National \nSecurity Agency to certify an encryption device and will \nlaunch after required certification test steps are completed, \nbut before receiving final certification documentation. \nAccording to SDA, the National Security Agency will provide \nSDA a temporary authority to operate the constellation with \nconditions until certification is complete. \nIn January 2024, SDA awarded three other transaction \nagreements for T2 TRK SVs.

SDA plans for end users to begin evaluating and \nproviding feedback on completed software in March 2026. \nSDA updated its PWSA cybersecurity strategy in July 2024. As \nrequired by DOD, the strategy takes a “zero trust” approach \nthat assumes an attacker is present in the environment. SDA \nconducted multiple cybersecurity assessments and plans \nfurther testing for both T1 TRK and T2 TRK. \nOther Program Issues \nSDA reported that it does not conduct formal technology or \nschedule risk assessments, and that the contractors conduct \ninformal assessments. SDA identified three system-level \ncritical technologies and described them as mature based on \nan informal assessment. However, SDA also identified several \ntechnologies within these systems that are key to the mission, \nincluding the infrared payloads, optical communications \nterminals, and encryption. Our best practices for evaluating \ntechnology readiness state that programs should select the \nnumber of critical technologies to evaluate based on multiple \nfactors, including program documents and consideration for \nthe newness of the operational environment.

They \nfurther noted that each current and future tranche will have \nsatellites with 5-year lifespans to allow for rapid technology \ninsertion in response to changing threats, and the MTA efforts \nwill not transition to the major capability acquisition pathway \nor other acquisition pathway. Rather, SDA refers to these \nsatellites as fieldable prototypes and is planning to launch its \nfirst T1TL satellites in summer 2025. This is a delay from the \noriginal planned launch date of September 2024, which \nprogram officials attribute to unexpected supply chain \nchallenges. \nFor both T1TL and T2TL, SDA identified three critical \ntechnologies. Additionally, it added a fourth for T2TL. SDA also \nidentified several technologies that are central to the success \nof the constellation, including optical communications \nterminals that support laser communications. However, SDA \nreported that it does not conduct formal technology risk \nassessments and schedule risk assessments, as those \nassessments are conducted informally by contractors. SDA \nplans to conduct operational testing in August 2025 for T1TL \nand in December 2026 for T2TL. \nLeading Product Development Practices \nSDA reported implementing some elements of leading \npractices for product development, but it is not fully \nimplementing the iterative efforts that we found lead to \nefficiencies. For example, the program stated that it \ndeveloped an iterative process and identified an MVP \nincorporating both stakeholder and user feedback. However, \nalthough the program identified the capabilities for an MVP, it \nis not taking the important step of fully demonstrating the \nMVP before moving forward with the next iteration. \nSpecifically, SDA officials said that performance outcomes of \nthe MVP in one tranche will not affect the schedule of other \ntranches. SDA officials reported that T0, the demonstration \ntranche, has demonstrated some communications capability, \nincluding radio frequency signals. However, SDA also reported \nthat T0 has only partially demonstrated a key capability—\nperformance of the optical communications terminal—and T0 \nhas not demonstrated its planned minimum viable capability. \nWe previously found that demonstrating an MVP—or \ncapability—before starting the next iteration is an important \naspect of iterative development used by leading companies. \nWe reported last year that by moving forward with two \nadditional iterations, T1TL and T2TL, before testing the initial \ndemonstration tranche, the program is missing an \nopportunity to validate planned capabilities. This continues to \nbe the case. \nSoftware and Cybersecurity \nSoftware development for T1TL and T2TL is part of an \nenterprise effort, including the T1 TRK and T2 TRK. Last year, \nprogram officials reported that they began software \ndevelopment in September 2022 for T1TL and expected to \ncomplete an MVP for software by April 2024. This year, they \nreported that SDA plans to involve end users in August 2025. \nThey also reported that they do not plan to use the software \nacquisition pathway since software development is incidental \nto the primary goal of the T1TL MTA effort. \nSDA updated its PWSA cybersecurity strategy in July 2024. The \nstrategy takes a “zero trust” approach required by DOD. This \napproach assumes that an attacker is present in the \nenvironment and minimizes access to resources. For T1TL, \nSDA conducted multiple cybersecurity assessments. This \nincludes an adversarial cybersecurity development test and \nevaluation, which conducts a cybersecurity event using \nrealistic threat response techniques to identify vulnerabilities. \nFor T2TL, SDA conducted a cyber table top exercise to explore \nthe eﬀects of cyber oﬀensive operations on overall mission \ncapability. SDA plans further cybersecurity testing for both \nT1TL and T2TL. \nOther Program Issues \nSDA reported that it conducted supply chain assessments, \nincluding market research, but oﬃcials reported signiﬁcant \nchallenges with ensuring access to required components. For \nexample, T1TL requires more than 500 optical \ncommunications terminals for the constellation’s 126 \nsatellites. However, oﬃcials reported that in January 2025, \nthe program had received 20 terminals. Oﬃcials stated that \nthis contributed to the delay of the program’s ﬁrst planned \nlaunch of T1TL satellites. SDA said it provided additional \nfunding to the terminal developers to increase production. \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office \nfor review and comment. It provided technical comments, \nwhich we incorporated where appropriate. The program \nstated that PWSA’s operational utility is based on sensing and \ncommunications provided by a constellation of mass-\nproducible space vehicles. According to the program, T0 \nreduced risk for Tranche 1 by demonstrating laser space links \nas well as demonstrating a radio frequency link from space to \nland, sea, and air assets for the first time, with no change in \nmission user equipment. The program stated that T1TL will \nprovide global communications and deliver regional \nconnectivity in support of the warfighters and serve as the \nbackbone for joint command and control. It added that T2TL \nwill expand T1TL capabilities with additional space vehicles for \ndata transport, bring in new communication modes to meet \nwarfighter demands for additional satellite communications, \nand provide relative navigation around the globe."

A lag in a processing system upgrade and subsequent delay \nto starting the operational utility evaluation delayed the first satellite’s initial \noperational capability by 7 months to April 2025, which, in turn, hindered its \noperational testing. The program office plans to meet full operational capability \nfor the first satellite by September 2025 and to have the second satellite \navailable for launch by January 2026, according to program officials. \nProgram officials reported that WSF is not applying iterative development \nbecause the program’s original performance parameters cannot be refined and \na minimum viable product was not needed. In contrast, we found that leading \ncompanies employ an iterative development approach that allows them to \nimprove on prior iterations as user needs evolve and technology advances. \nOfficials said that the program incorporated user feedback at the beginning of \nthe acquisition, and that it considered user involvement during development, \nbut did not have user agreements in place. Officials said that they are \ncoordinating an end user agreement for the satellite control authority after \nfielding the first satellite. \nThe second satellite is a production carbon copy of the first satellite, and the \nprogram does not plan to make changes to the design or manufacturing \nprocesses unless the first satellite has on-orbit system issues with a direct \nmission effect. Currently, officials are proving the design and data quality of the \nfirst satellite using on-orbit calibration and validation data, they told us. They \nsaid that they identified an on-orbit radio interference issue that the prime \nvendor will analyze, and the program office will later determine whether any \nmitigating actions, such as design changes, are warranted.  \nProgram Oﬃce Comments \nWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and \ncomment.

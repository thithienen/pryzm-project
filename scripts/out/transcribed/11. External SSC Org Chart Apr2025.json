Deputy Commander, Senior Enlisted Leader, Director of Staff, and Mobilization Assistant are direct-report/adjacent advisory roles around the Commander. \n\n\nStaff Offices (S-codes) — report through Director of Staff to the Commander\n\nS1 — Human Capital: Mr. Ralph Taylor\n\nS2 — Intel: Col Thomas Laflash\n\nS3/7 — Operations & Readiness: Col Timothy Paget\n\nS4 — Sustainment & Logistics: Mr. Bradley Leonard\n\nS5/8 — Plans, Requirements, & Programming: Mr. Luke Schaub\n\nS6 — Chief Information Officer: Col Craig Frank\n\nS9/10 — Analysis & Nuclear Systems: Col Jon Strizzi\n\nWarfighter Integration: Col Minpo Shiue\n\nInternational Affairs: Mr. Rich Saxon (Acting)\n\nDirector of Contracting: Ms. Natalie Riedel, SES\n\nRelation note: These S-offices are functional staff elements that support the enterprise and operational arms; they coordinate policy, planning, readiness, sustainment, CIO, intel, analysis, etc., feeding decisions up to the Commander and enabling PEOs/field units. \n\n\nEnterprise Capability Offices (Program Executive/Directorates) — acquisition & mission portfolios\n\nSpace Systems Integration Office: Mr. James Haywood\n\nBattle Management, Command, Control & Communications (BMC3I): Ms. Shannon Pallone\n\nAssured Access to Space (AATS): Brig Gen Kristin Panzenhagen\n\nSpace Domain Awareness & Combat Power (SDACP): Col Bryon McClain\n\nOperational Test & Training Infrastructure (OTTI): Col Corey Klopstein\n\nSpace Sensing: Col Robert Davis\n\nMilComm & PNT: Mr. Cordell DeLaPena, SES\n\nRelation note: These are the PEO/Director organizations that own portfolios (launch, comms/PNT, sensing, SDA/combat power, battle management/C3, test & training, enterprise integration). They are parallel peers accountable for capability delivery, tied to the Service Acquisition authority. They coordinate horizontally with Staff Offices and vertically with field units for execution. \n\n\nField / Base Organizations (Operations units under Space Launch Deltas & Base Delta)\n\nSLD 30 — Vandenberg SFB: Col Mark Shoemaker\n\nSLD 45 — Patrick SFB: Brig Gen Kristin Panzenhagen\n\nSpace Base Delta 3 — Los Angeles AFB: Col Andrew Dermanoski\n\nDetachment 1 — Kirtland AFB: Col Joseph Roth\n\nDetachment 5 — Peterson SFB: Lt Col Charles DeBree\n\nRelation note: These are operational/installation commands (Deltas/Det's) that execute launch operations, base support, and mission support, interfacing with the acquisition PEOs (e.g., AATS) and the Staff Offices. Panzenhagen appears both as SLD-45 commander and as PEO for AATS in the portfolio layer, reflecting dual-hatted roles across operations and acquisition. \n\n\nSecretariat / Executive Roles on the Page\n\nExecutive Director: Ms. Joy White, SES — senior civilian exec supporting the Command. \n\n\nAtlas label (shown near executive names): appears as a layout label adjacent to Ms. Deidra Eberhardt, SES; context indicates part of the executive/enterprise framing on the slide rather than a separate directorate header on this page. \n\n\nHow the pieces connect (for downstream LLM reasoning)\n\nCommander at the top → supported by Deputy, SEL, Director of Staff, Mobilization Assistant. \n\n\nStaff Offices (S-codes) → provide functional governance (HR, intel, ops/readiness, logistics, plans/PPBE, CIO, analysis/nuclear, contracting, international, warfighter integration) that shape policy and resources across the command. \n\n\nEnterprise Capability Offices (PEOs/Directors) → own acquisition portfolios delivering capabilities (Launch, BMC3I, SDACP, Sensing, MilComm & PNT, OTTI, Enterprise Integration). They align to the Service Acquisition authority and coordinate with Staff Offices and field units. \n\n\nField Units (SLDs / Base Delta / Detachments) → execute operations and base support, interfacing with PEOs for capability deployment (e.g., AATS ↔ SLD-30/45 for launch). Some leaders (e.g., Brig Gen Panzenhagen) are dual-hatted across both layers, indicating tight coupling between acquisition and operations."

Bulson\n\nMission Focus Areas:\n\nPoint-to-Point\n\nOn-Orbit\n\nRelationship note: AAA owns the emerging space mobility/logistics tech and acquisitions (rapid point-to-point space transport, on-orbit services), coordinating with AATS staff lanes and testing/ops partners.\n\nLaunch Execution — AAL\n\nDirector: Col J. Horne\n\nSEL: SMSgt C. Wall\n\nMission Focus Areas:\n\nULA Senior Lead\n\nSpaceX Senior Lead\n\nAtlas/Delta Systems\n\nVulcan Systems\n\nFalcon Systems\n\nRelationship note: AAL is the provider-facing execution arm for national security space launch. It owns day-to-day vendor integration and launch system execution, and synchronizes with SLD-30/45 operations.\n\nMission Solutions — AAM (SML)\n\nDirector: Col M. Flahive (shown as \"SML Col M. Flahive\")\n\nMission Focus Areas:\n\nRocket Systems Launch Program\n\nPayload Management & Mission Integration (MMO)\n\nFuture Procurement (NSSL Phase 3)\n\nEnterprise Acquisitions\n\nRelationship note: AAM/SML handles the procurement/programmatics—fleet sustainment, payload integration, and NSSL Phase 3 future buys—feeding requirements/contracting lanes and handing off to AAL for execution.\n\nOperations / Installation Command Linkages\nSpace Launch Delta 45 — Patrick SFB\n\nCommander: Brig Gen K. Panzenhagen (dual-hatted with AATS PEO)\n\nAssigned Group & Squadrons (partial list as rendered on the page):\n\n45 MDG\n\n… (additional SLD-45 units listed on the slide; page shows a multi-bullet block)\n\n5 SLS\n\n45 CES, 45 FSS, 45 LRS, 45 CONS, 45 SFS\n\n45 CPTS, 45 WS\n\nDET 2 – Ascension\n\nDelta Staff Agencies\n\nSpace Launch Delta 30 — Vandenberg SFB\n\nCommander: Col M.

Harris\n\nRelationship note: SLD-30 and SLD-45 are the launch operations commands at Vandenberg and Patrick, respectively. They execute range, infrastructure, and mission support. They are tightly coupled to AATS:\n• AAM procures systems and payload integration →\n• AAL integrates with launch providers and schedules vehicles →\n• SLDs run the pads, ranges, and ops to actually launch.\nDual-hatting of Brig Gen Panzenhagen binds acquisition (AATS) and operations (SLD-45) for unity of effort.\n\nPage-level Context Summary (for downstream reasoning)\n\nThis page is the AATS org sheet: who runs the launch acquisition enterprise, which sub-directorates exist (AAA, AAL, AAM/SML), what mission focus areas each owns, and how they interface with operational deltas (SLD-30 and SLD-45).\n\nCross-links: AATS staff functions ↔ sub-directorates; AAM (procurement) ↔ AAL (execution) ↔ SLD-30/45 (ops); vendor/system lines (ULA/Vulcan/Falcon) sit under Launch Execution; future buy (NSSL Phase 3) sits under Mission Solutions; emerging mobility/on-orbit concepts sit under AAA."

Works horizontally with Space Enterprise Support to ensure the superiority mission threads fit the broader DAF Battle Network patterns.\n\n3) Global Mission Operations\n\nLead: Col N. Barnas\n\nRelation: Bridges operations concepts and readiness across SSC portfolios (e.g., ensuring fielded capabilities, TTPs, and C2 pathways are integrated end-to-end). Partners with operational Deltas to validate enterprise integration in live ops.\n\n4) Enterprise Integration\n\nRelation: The core architecture & standards engine—harmonizes interfaces, data models, reference designs, and end-to-end mission thread alignment across all PEOs (BMC3I, AATS, SDACP, Sensing, MCPNT, OTTI).\n\n5) Enterprise Test & Evaluation\n\nRelation: Owns enterprise-level T&E constructs (integrated test campaigns, cross-portfolio testbeds, verification of interoperability and resilience) to prove that capabilities work together under realistic conditions.\n\n6) Space Environment\n\nRelation: Provides space-environment characterization (space weather, environmental effects, modeling/analysis) that feeds standards, architectures, and T&E so designs and operations account for real environmental constraints.\n\nHow SSIO ties the enterprise together (for downstream reasoning)\n\nDirectorate core (Haywood + deputies/tech director/IMA) sets enterprise integration priorities and governance.\n\nSpace Enterprise Support defines mission-thread patterns across sensors → C2 → effectors → network, aligned to the DAF Battle Network; this is the linchpin for interoperability.\n\nSpace Superiority and Global Mission Ops ensure that doctrinal/operational imperatives (domain control, readiness, ops integration) are reflected in enterprise architectures and test plans.\n\nEnterprise Integration + Enterprise T&E enforce common interfaces, data standards, and end-to-end verification, preventing stovepipes across SSC portfolios.\n\nSpace Environment injects real-world environmental factors into designs, tests, and ops so the integrated enterprise holds up in practice.\n\nNet effect: SSIO is the horizontal \"systems-of-systems\" integrator for SSC—authoring common patterns, validating them in T&E, and pushing them into ops—so that all the vertical PEO portfolios can plug into a single, resilient battle network rather than ship bespoke, incompatible solutions."

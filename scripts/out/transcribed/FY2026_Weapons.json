The Fiscal \nYear (FY) 20 26 Investment accounts (Procurement and Research, Developme nt, Test, and \nEvaluation (RDT&E )) funding request ed by  the Department of Defense (DoD) totals \n$384.3 billion, which includes $205.2 billion for Procurement and $179.1 billion for RDT&E.  The \nfunding in the budget request represents a balanced portfolio approach for the implementation of \nthe Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance (INDSG).   \n          \nNotes:  Reflects DoD total obligation authority and includes both Mandatory and Discretionary funds in FY 2026.  \nProcurement and RDT&E funds requested in the DoD’s Reconciliation Request are $51.9 billion and $37.1 billion, \nrespectively.     \nIn FY 2026, the Investment portfolio increases to 40 percent of DoD total funding.  The request \nis comprised of over 2,049 Program, Project, and Activity (PPA) budget line items, of which 914 \nare Procurement and 1,135 are RDT&E. \n   \nReconciliation \nThe Department’s President’s Budget (PB) 2026 request totals $961.6 billion and is presented in \ntwo bills, $848.3 billion in the discretionary budget and $113.3 billion in the mandatory budget \nfrom the Reconciliation bill.  \nThis budget prioritizes investments to strengthen the safety, security, and sovereignty of the \nhomeland; deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific; and revitalize the U.S. defense industrial \nbase.  In FY 2026, the Investment accounts total 78.6 percent , or approximately $89.0 billion, of \nthe $113.3 billion included in the FY  2026 budget.  Because the mandatory budget request for \nInvestment accounts represents a significant percentage (23  percent) to the total, individual \nweapons system pages reflect columns for both discretionary and mandatory funds, if applicable.    \nFY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26\nRDT&E 74.8 92.2 96.2 106.1 107.1 119.5 140.9 149.5 141.4 179.1\nProcurement 126.0 148.2 148.6 144.1 142.9 155.5 182.3 204.6 174.4 205.2\nTotal DoD 609.3 673.0 693.0 725.8 711.0 769.5 858.3 897.6 861.7 961.7\nInv % of Total 33.0% 35.7% 35.3% 34.5% 35.2% 35.7% 37.7% 39.4% 36.6% 40.0%\n -\n 50.0\n 100.0\n 150.0\n 200.0\n 250.0\n 300.0\n 350.0\n 400.0\nResearch and Procurement Totals\n($ in Billions)"

Since ending production in 1994, \nthe Army has modernized the Abrams through \nSystem Enhancement Package (SEP) programs \nand Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to \nimprove survivability, lethality, sustainability, \nand supportability on the modern battlefield.  \nThe current modification elevates the Abrams to \nthe M1 A2 SEP version 3 (SEPv3)  standard.  \nThis package  includes an Ammunition Data \nLink to enable usage of the M1147 Advanced \nMulti-Purpose (AMP) round; improved sensing through the Improved Forward-Looking Infrared  \n(IFLIR) system and the Commander’s Remote Operated Weapon Station - Low Profile (CROWS-\nLP); an under armor Auxiliary Power Unit (APU); electronics upgrades including a new Vehicle \nHealth Management System with internal Line Replaceable Modules; improved power generation \nand distribution; enhanced networking and communications capabilities; and improved protection \nthrough Abrams Reactive Armor Tile (ARAT) and other armor upgrades, next -generation IED \ndefense, and provision for Active Protection System (APS) emplacement.  In addition to the AMP, \nthe SEPv3 is equipped with the M829A4 kinetic energy round for improved anti-armor operations. \n \nMission:  Dominate adversaries through lethal firepower, unparalleled survivability, and \naudacious maneuver across the battlespace. \n \nFY 2026 Program:  Continues M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 production through procurement of 30 \nSEPv3 upgrade kits, including technology maturation testing for incorporation of the \nMeteorological Sensor, Laser Warning Receiver, and Thermal Management System into existing \nand future SEPv3 units.  In May 2023, Army leadership  approved a new, more comprehensive \nECP called the Abrams M1E3, which resulted in a strategic shift to the Abrams modernization \nparadigm.  Accordingly , the Army will not pursue the SEPv4 but will roll  various constituent \ntechnologies into the  newly announced M1E3.  The Abrams M1E3 will harness new and \ndeveloping technologies  to produce a lighter tank that is more mo bile, lethal, and survivable.   \nPotential technologies include a hybrid- electric drive for increased fuel efficiency and reduced \nsignature; an autoloader and new main gun; advanced munitions; enhanced communications and \ncontrol equipment to network with unmanned air and ground vehicles; and improved protection to \ninclude an active protection system.

      "text": "FY 2026 Program Acquisition Costs by Weapon System \nMissiles & Munitions \n5-19 \nThe Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) is a lightweight, \nquick-reaction, surface -to-air missile designed to \nprotect ships from anti -ship missiles, helicopters, \naircraft, and surface craft.  This Navy program is  a \npoint-defense weapon system intended to be the last \nline of defense against incoming threats that have \npenetrated other defensive layers.   RIM-116 is the \nlauncher for RAM.  The system’s design is based upon \nthe infrared (IR) seeker of the Stinger (FIM -92) \nmissile, and the warhead, rocket motor, and fuse from \nthe Sidewinder (AIM-9) missile. \n \nNavy RAM uses the Mk 49 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS), a  21-round launcher, as \nwell as the SeaRAM , which is a  variant that replaces the radar sensor of the Phalanx Close- In \nWeapon System (CIWS) with an 11-round RAM launcher.  This provides a more effective defense \nagainst anti-ship missiles than the original Phalanx system.   It’s designed to intercept threats that \nhave evaded longer-range air defense systems.  Its automated detection, tracking, and engagement \nsequence minimizes the time between target acquisition and missile launch, increasing the \nprobability of a successful intercept. \n \nThe RAM utilizes a unique dual-mode guidance system using a radio frequency (RF) guidance to \nintercept the target .  As it gets closer, it transitions to infrared (IR) homing, which is less \nsusceptible to electronic countermeasures and provides greater accuracy.

These weapons, capable of traveling at speeds exceeding \nMach 5 (five times the speed of sound), pose unprecedented challenges to traditional defense \nsystems and doctrines. \nTheir defining characteristic is incredible speed, exceeding Mach 5 or roughly 3,800 miles per \nhour.  Unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, many hypersonic weapons \nare highly maneuverable, making them difficult to intercept. \nHypersonic Missiles fall into two main categories:  Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGVs), launched \nby a rocket to high altitudes, then glide to their target ; and Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCMs) , \npowered by scramjet engines for sustained hypersonic flight.  \nCurrent radar and satellite systems are not optimized for detecting and tracking hypersonic \nweapons.  Their speed, maneuverability, and lower flight paths make them difficult to follow.    \nExisting missile defense systems are largely ineffective against them.   The short flight times of \nhypersonic weapons significantly reduce the time available for decision- making and response.  \nThis creates a \"use it or lose it\" scenario for command and control. \nThe speed and surprise element of hypersonic weapons could increase the risk of miscalculation \nand escalation in a conflict.  A nation might be tempted to use them preemptively, fearing a first \nstrike by the adversary.  The development and deployment of hypersonic weapons is not limited \nto a few nations.  As the technology matures, there is a risk of proliferation to other countries, \npotentially destabilizing regional and global security. \nDeveloping effective defenses against hypersonic weapons is a major priority for many countries.  \nThis includes improving detection and tracking capabilities, developing new interceptor \ntechnologies, and exploring alternative defensive strategies such as directed energy weapons. \nThe FY 2026  budget request continues funding for projects designed to enhance hypersonic \ndefense against adversary hypersonic threats; development and production of offensive system s, \nincluding Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt \nStrike (IRCPS), and the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM); the Multi-Service Advanced \nCapability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) , and science and technology development for \ncontinued improvements in low-observable weapon form factors, lethality, and survivability."

Hypersonic \nDefense requires a layered approach encompassing \nadvanced sensors, high- speed interceptors, automated \ncommand and control systems, and strategic deterrence. \n \nHypersonic Defenses include: \n• Early Warning Systems:  Networks of ground-based radars, space-based sensors, and over-the-\nhorizon radar systems to detect launches as early as possible. \n• Tracking and Discrimination: Advanced radar systems (e.g., the  Aegis Combat System) and \nother sensing modalities (e.g., Space- Based Infrared System)  are needed to accurately track \nhypersonic missiles and discriminate them from decoys. \n• Interception Systems:  This area is under heavy research and development, with potential \nsolutions including Directed Energy Weapons , ground or sea -based h ypersonic missile \ninterceptors, and improved hit-to-kill technologies. \n \nMission:  Protect against the unique threat of hypersonic weapons and prevent them from \nsuccessfully striking U.S. and allied forces through reliable detection, tracking, and defeat. \n \nFY 2026 Program:   Hypersonic Defense programs include s pace-based sensors such as the \nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) and Space Development Agency’s Hypersonic Ballistic Tracking \nSpace System (HBTSS); and improved ground-based radars with enhanced range, sensitivity, and \nprocessing.  In addition, MDA is pursuing a Glide Phase Intercept  (GPI) capability and directed \nenergy weapons, the Navy is continuing Standard Missile research against hypersonic threats, and \nthe Army remains committed to its Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) portfolio through \nthe Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and PAC-3 MSE interceptor enhancements. \n \nPrime Contractor(s):  RTX Corporation; Arlington, VA \n  L3-Harris Technologies, Inc.; Melbourne, FL \n  Northrop Grumman Corporation; Falls Church, VA \n  Lockheed Martin Corporation; Bethesda, MD\n \n \nQty $M Qty $M Qty $M Qty $M Qty $M\nRDT&E\nUSA -           3.9           -            38.1         -           158.0            -          192.0              -           350.0            \nUSN -           366.2       -            288.3       -           413.0            -          -                    -           413.0            \nMDA -           417.0       -            353.0       -           365.1            -          247.0              -           612.1            \nSubtotal -           787.1       -          679.4       -         936.0            -        439.0               -         1,375.0         \nProcure me nt\nUSA -           2,814.9    -            905.1       -           945.9            -          366.0              -           1,311.9         \n   Total -           3,602.0    -            1,584.4    -           1,881.9         -          805.0              -           2,686.9         \nFY 2026 TOTAL\nHypersonic Defense\nFY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 (MAND.)FY 2026 (DISC.)\n \n                        Numbers may not add due to rounding                                                                            \nHypersonic Defenses"

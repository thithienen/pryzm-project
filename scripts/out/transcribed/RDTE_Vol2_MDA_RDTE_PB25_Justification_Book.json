The MDA designs, develops, and \ndelivers capabilities through the Services to meet Combatant Commands (CCMDS) joint requirements, and sustains advanced missile \ndefense systems as part of the fully integrated and layered Missile Defense System. \nMDA’s budget request for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 is $10.4 billion.  The FY 2025 budget will continue the development, rigorous \ntesting and fielding of reliable, increasingly capable, advanced missile defenses.  The Agency’s priorities for missile defense are: \n1) Operations and Readiness. \n2) Production, Fielding, and Deployment.  \n3) Technology, Development, and Test. \nMDA will continue to collaborate closely with CCMDs and the Services to support current and future needs for missile defense \ncapabilities.  MDA and these key stakeholders are leveraging the existing all-domain Missile Defense System to develop integrated \narchitectures and capabilities to counter the evolving missile threat from ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles.  This budget request \nmaintains operational missile defense capacity and capabilities for existing homeland and regional defense forces; increases \ninterceptor inventory and maturation of defensive technologies; and improves existing sensors and the Command and Control, Battle \nManagement and Communications (C2BMC) system. \nConsistent with the National Defense Strategy, the Missile Defense Review, and the Defense Planning Guidance, MDA’s budget \nreflects a careful and comprehensive balancing of programs and resources to provide missile defense capabilities, as a key deterrence-\nby-denial component of integrated deterrence.  MDA’s budget includes funding to improve homeland missile defense against \nIntercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) threats from North Korea and potentially Iran.  It also invests in regional Integrated Air and \nVolume 2a - xxii"

In response to \nincreasing threats in the Indo-Pacific region, MDA is supporting efforts to improve the Warfighter's capability to defend Guam against \nregional ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles.  FY 2025 funding will support activities to continue development and deployment \nof an effective defensive architecture solution.  \nMDA continues to make significant progress in cybersecurity by incorporating threat-informed requirements for cyber resiliency and \nsurvivability into system specifications and then implementing rigorous evaluation-based testing and assessments early in the \ndevelopment to find and fix problems before releasing systems for integrated testing.  MDA is building cybersecurity into next-\ngeneration software processes by leveraging proven secure software development, security, and operations, and establishing \ncontinuous integration.  MDA established a Defensive Cyberspace Operations organization in 2022, which uses certified cyber teams \nto evaluate capabilities to enhance our cybersecurity posture.  \nMissile Threat \nMissile threats continue to increase, growing more numerous and complex.  Adversary missile systems are becoming more mobile, \nsurvivable, reliable, and accurate while also achieving longer ranges.  Hypersonic glide vehicles delivered by missile boosters are an \nemerging threat that pose new challenges to missile defense systems.  Adversary missile pre-launch survivability is likely to increase \nas potential adversaries strengthen their denial and deception measures and increasingly base missiles on mobile platforms.  Increasing \ntechnical and operational countermeasures continue to challenge defensive systems in missiles.  New missile systems feature multiple \nindependently targetable reentry vehicles and maneuverable reentry vehicles, along with decoys and other countermeasures.  Ballistic \nVolume 2a - xxiii"

Our adversaries \nare not only developing more complex and advanced threats to counter Missile Defense System assets, but are also increasing the \namount of missiles in inventory in an effort to overwhelm the Missile Defense System. \nMissiles continue to be a primary means for adversaries to project power, coerce, and inhibit or disrupt U.S. military operations in a \ncrisis or conflict.  Maneuvering missiles, such as hypersonic glide vehicles, provide a challenge to existing defensive systems because \nthey can travel on unpredictable flight paths at low altitudes making them difficult to track using standard terrestrial radar systems.  \nConsequently, the continued investment in development of long range and resilient sensor technologies and capabilities, to include \nthose that could support a space sensor network is essential for tracking, discriminating and engaging advanced missile threats.  North \nKorea is developing long-range ballistic missile systems that can reach the U.S. and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region.  It has also \ntested shorter range missiles that maneuver within the atmosphere.  Iran continues to develop more sophisticated missiles with \nimproved accuracy, range, and lethality, and it is fielding an array of increasingly accurate short- and medium-range ballistic missile \nsystems capable of threatening deployed U.S. forces, allies, and partners in the Middle East.  It has combined ballistic or cruise \nmissiles and unmanned aerial vehicles in complex attacks. \nMajor Program Element Highlights \nThe following discussion summarizes the highlights of major Program Elements (PE) in order of the Missile Defense System battle \nsequence:  Detect, Control, and Engage. \n \nAn engagement sequence begins when the missile defense system sensors (radars and satellites) detect the launch of threat missiles \nand track/discriminate them in flight, maintaining birth-to-death custody of the threats.  C2BMC processes these tracks to generate the \nsystem track representation of the threat attack.  C2BMC subsequently tasks the sensors to collect source track data for fire control \nquality system tracks to support the appropriate weapon systems in engagement of the threats.  The weapon systems develop fire \nVolume 2a - xxiv"

MDA’s C2BMC is the all-domain backbone that enables \nMissile Defense System engagements. \nNote:  The following discussion does not fully describe all funding or activities included within each PE. \nI.  Detect and Control \nMDA delivers, maintains, and upgrades C2BMC capability across 19 time zones with hardened networks supporting U.S. Northern \nCommand (USNORTHCOM), U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), U.S. \nCentral Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) and Missile Defense Radars for missile defense and \nspace domain awareness mission support.  C2BMC provides a common operating missile defense picture for decision makers and the \nCCMDs and is capable of generating and distributing fire control quality data to missile defense assets.  The Warfighter also uses this \nsystem to understand what is happening in real time in current conflict zones.  The budget request includes: \n C2BMC (PE 0603896C).  MDA is requesting $569.7 million in FY 2025 for C2BMC.  C2BMC provides the capability for \npersistent acquisition, centralized multi-sensor tracking, cueing, discrimination, and distribution of fire-control quality system \ntrack data to the Aegis Weapon System, Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense \n(THAAD), Patriot, Space Command and Control (C2) and coalition partners to support homeland and regional defense.  \nMDA’s C2BMC capabilities support Warfighter needs across the globe by providing the Combatant Commander with sensor \nmanagement, the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) planner, situational awareness tools, and battle management capability.  \nThese tools support global missile defense situational awareness, coalition operations, weapons release authority for homeland \ndefense, and control of and tasking to a variety of Missile Defense System radars.  C2BMC operators and maintainers deploy \nto some of the world's most threatening regions and continue to provide around-the-clock support to local commanders. \n– In FY 2025, MDA will sustain the fielded C2BMC capability (Spiral 8.2-5) in USNORTHCOM, USINDOPACOM, \nUSEUCOM, USCENTCOM, USSTRATCOM, and USSPACECOM Areas of Responsibilities, which includes the \nfollowing capabilities:  integration and C2 of the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) including support tasking for \nVolume 2a - xxv"

Neither documentation \nfrom the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) nor the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) books match the \ninformation for additional funds included in the Services' justification documents. Nor do the descriptions of \nactivities seem to change. In examining the documents, some of the descriptions are exactly the same year to year.   \nTherefore, the Committee directs that the PDI and EDI justification documents be augmented with the submission of \nthe fiscal year 2024 justification materials to include the following: \n(1) Each individual activity receiving funds will include the amount of increase in funding (not an overall top line \nincrease);  \n(2) Each individual activity will also include the baseline of funds from the previous fiscal year. Each augmented \nprogram or activity will specify which service, account, subactivity group or program element line is increasing. \nSubmitted in the FY2025 Budget \nJustification Materials in PE \n0604102C (Guam Defense \nDevelopment); 0603892C (Aegis \nBMD); 0603896C (BMD C2BMC); \n0603914C (BMD Test); 0603915C \n(BMD Targets); 0604878C (Aegis \nBMD Test); 0604879C (BMD \nSensor Test); and 0208902C \n(Defense of Guam Procurement) \n \n \nFY22 National Defense \nAuthorization Act (S. \n1605), Public Law 117-\n81, p. 566 \nNEXT GENERATION INTERCEPTORS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES \nHOMELAND \nThe Director of the Missile Defense Agency shall develop a funding plan that includes funding lines across the \nfuture-years defense program under section 221 of title 10, United States Code, for the next generation interceptor \nthat – (1) while applying lessons learned from the redesigned kill vehicle program, incorporating recommendations \nfrom the Comptroller General of the United States, and implementing “fly-before-you-buy” principles, produces and \nbegins deployment of the next generation interceptor as early as practicable; (2) includes acquiring at least 20 \noperational next generation interceptors; and (3) includes transition plans to replace the current inventory of silo-\nbased boosters with follow-on systems prior to the end of the useful lifecycle of the boosters. \nSubmitted in the FY2025 Budget \nJustification Materials in PE \n0604874C (Improved Homeland \nDefense Interceptors) \nFY19 National Defense \nAuthorization Act (H.R. \n5515), Report 115-863, \npp. 257-258; \nFY20 National Defense \nAuthorization Act (S. \n1790), Report 116-333, \np. 338 \n \nCONSOLIDATED BUDGET DISPLAY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SMALL BUSINESS \nINNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER \nPROGRAM \nThe Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, shall include \nin the materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in support of the budget of the President for each \nfiscal year (as submitted to Congress under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code), a budget display for the \nfunds assessed for the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram (as such terms are defined, respectively, in section 9(e) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(e))) of the \nDepartment of Defense during the previous fiscal year. \nMODIFICATIONS TO BUDGET DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nSMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY \nTRANSFER PROGRAM \nSection 857 of the John S.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Advanced Concepts and Performance Assessment (ACPA) Program Element delivers a government concept that integrates concept definition, simulation, analysis,\nand testbed capability.  ACPA's focus is on the exploration of novel and/or emerging capabilities that may have the potential to enhance the Missile Defense System.\nACPA centralizes assessment of advanced missile defense technology and delivers insight into the performance of proposed concepts extending the Missile Defense\nAgency's (MDA) ability to address evolving threats for the Warfighter. Working with national laboratories and industry, MDA will invest in the analysis and assessment of\ndirected energy system components to determine their effectiveness and capability for missile defense.\nSubject Matter Experts provide independent assessments of government, university, and industry technology concepts, used in concert with systems engineering\nrequirements, to support acquisition strategy decisions and define technology focus areas.  The innovative structured concept definition and assessment methodology\nenables MDA to quickly validate focus areas, verify contractor technology solutions, and evaluate promising concepts in future Missile Defense System architectures.\nThis methodology significantly enhances MDA's ability to assess technology concepts while decreasing the cost of development by:\n- Delivering Independent model-based simulations of industry technology concepts to inform the systems engineering process\n- Quantifying expectations through algorithms, digital simulation, hardware-in-the-loop, and/or demonstration events prior to expensive live fire test events\n- Executing end-to-end testing of technology concepts integrated with weapon systems through Command and Control network architectures\n- Maturing and conducting assessments of new technologies to evaluate their readiness for transition to the future Missile Defense System\n- Supports early coordination with the program elements to promote efficient integration into the Missile Defense System and provide additional capability to meet the\nWarfighter needs\nPerformance assessment of advanced concepts is the key enabler for government evaluation of technology in the earliest stages of development and maximizes the\nefficiency of technology investments.  Performance assessment is used to quantify capability expectations of innovative concepts to counter the expanding regional and\nhomeland missile threats, including ballistic and cruise missiles, and hypersonic vehicles.\nVolume 2a - 1"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nAdvanced Concepts and Performance Assessments (ACPA) centralizes advanced technology concept modeling, simulation, software, and analysis.  Integrating models\nof promising disruptive technical solutions into Missile Defense System system-level simulations enables leadership to make data driven acquisition and technology\ninvestment decisions.  Assess concepts that improve or adapt existing systems, that incorporate mobile sensors and interceptors that can be surged into zones of\ncrisis or conflict are also deemed disruptive.  Examples of efforts required to quantify the contribution of disruptive technologies may include, but not be limited to\nenvironmental experimentation and phenomenological characterization required for new sensor concepts, advanced weapon technologies, and emerging directed\nenergy concepts.  Using a technology development testbed approach, ACPA enables assessment and characterization of incremental technology improvements to\ninform requirements and evaluate missile defense elements, components, and/or sub-component technologies and to assess maturity as it relates to readiness for\ntransition to the future Missile Defense System.  ACPA promotes informed decision making early in the acquisition life-cycle to maximize investments and successful\ntransition into the Missile Defense System.\nCoupled with characterization efforts, ACPA develops innovative left-through-right-of-launch modeling capabilities including physics-based representations in the areas\nof cyber, sensor technologies, lethality and survivability, communications, and sensor support.  ACPA is focusing on Science and Technology initiatives which increase\ninteroperability and leverages expertise with allied and service partners.\nACPA capitalizes on the innovation of small businesses, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated\nResearch Centers (UARCs) to pursue a broad range of hardware, software, models, algorithms, trade studies, and analysis.  These innovations bring together\ngovernment developed models representing existing and future missile defense architectures, technology concepts, and advanced algorithms to provide detailed\nassessments of concept performance and inform investment decisions. These innovations, combined with a robust high performance computing infrastructure, provide\na unique in-house government capability to demonstrate and assess technology concepts for emerging technology risk reduction, to mature concepts with laboratory,\nground, and flight test data, and where possible, apply concepts in simulated exercises with weapon systems across representative communication architectures.\nB.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development.\nThe Agency acquisition strategy ensures GMD components are upgraded to improve both GMD Component performance and GMD Element performance in order to\nretain the proven GMD contribution to the integrated Missile Defense System. This acquisition approach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability\nimprovements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost, schedule, and performance while rapidly delivering improved operational and\ntechnological capabilities.\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) competitively awarded the Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) to The Boeing Company in December 2011. This contract\nincluded development, fielding, test, systems engineering, integration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrade; training, operations, and\nsustainment of the GMD Element and associated support facilities. In January 2018, the DSC was extended with a new period of performance through 1Q FY 2024.  The\nDSC Extension includes supporting test, engineering, software, and performance-based logistics scope. In 2022, the MDA Ground Test Replan resulted in the extension\nof minimal contract line items to support testing, engineering, hardware and software until December 2024 to complete the delivery of Missile Defense System Increment\n6B.2; while performance-based logistics will transition to a new contract after December 2023. The DSC structure breaks out major efforts into separate Contract Line\nItem Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nMDA implemented a robust Program Board structure allowing more Government insight and decisions into the technical baseline and has changed business processes\nfor greater Government involvement in program decisions consistent with the Government's ownership of the technical baseline.  In addition, GMD utilizes Government\nlaboratory modeling and simulation and analysis capabilities to augment the current DSC efforts. These efforts utilize existing, competitively awarded contracts by\nMDA and Other Government Agencies including Vandenberg Space Force Base, California; Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center; U.S. Army Combat\nVolume 2a - 63"

Each of the new\ncontracts are structured to break out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property\naccountability.\nMDA competitively awarded two best value contracts on March 24, 2021 to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for technology and product development of Next\nGeneration Interceptor and maintained both contracts through the PDR. Each Contractor's design development and component testing leading to completion of a PDR\nand Knowledge Point #1 provides significant risk reduction and confidence to select a single Next Generation Interceptor All Up Round design to proceed to the Critical\nDesign Review and beyond.  MDA established future knowledge points and flight tests to evaluate Next Generation Interceptor components and GMD Weapon System\nperformance during continued development and to support future production decisions.\nMDA awarded/plans to award sole source contracts to the GMD's Ground Based Interceptor In-Service Fleet (ISF) original equipment manufacturers to perform service\nlife extensions and maintain the existing fleet, execute repairs, and develop software.  These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until replacement\ninterceptors Next Generation Interceptor are fielded.  ISF is constrained to the legacy interceptor fleet and its component boosters and kill vehicles. The Boost Vehicle\nSustainment Contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021.  The EKV Sustainment Contract was awarded in June 2023 to Raytheon Missile\nSystems.  The Ground Based Interceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award in FY 2024.\nThe GMD Weapon System (GWS) Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to provide design, development,\nproduction, product level testing, sustainment planning, and maintenance of the current Weapon System.  The GWS contractor is responsible for developing weapon\nsystem solutions, including fire control and communication systems improvements, required to update the legacy system to remain effective while the Next Generation\nInterceptor is under development, as well as, preparing for the seamless introduction of Next Generation Interceptor and other future Missile Defense System\ncapabilities.  The GWS contract will update the system interface for the addition of Next Generation Interceptors to the fleet, provide the Warfighter capability to operate\nthe GMD Weapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, and identify and develop solutions for message exchanges\nbetween the GMD Weapon System and in-flight kill vehicles.  All of this must be accomplished while maintaining a robust cyber defense network capable of detecting\nand defending against current and future cybersecurity threats.\nMDA also competitively awarded a System Integration, Test, and Readiness (SITR) Contract to provide, along with the Technical Direction Agent, a synergistic\napproach in executing the GMD Element-level engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the GMD Weapon System, which operates with the current Ground-\nBased Interceptor and is adding infrastructure for the integration and testing of Next Generation Interceptor.  The SITR contract was awarded on September 1, 2022 to\nThe Boeing Company. The SITR contractor is charged with being the Government's technical partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon\nSystem alongside the United States Northern Command Warfighters.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development.\nThe Agency acquisition strategy ensures GMD components are upgraded to improve both GMD Component performance and GMD Element performance in order to\nretain the proven GMD contribution to the integrated Missile Defense System. This acquisition approach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability\nimprovements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost, schedule, and performance while rapidly delivering improved operational and\ntechnological capabilities.\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) competitively awarded the Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) to The Boeing Company in December 2011. This contract\nincluded development, fielding, test, systems engineering, integration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrade; training, operations, and\nsustainment of the GMD Element and associated support facilities. In January 2018, the DSC was extended with a new period of performance through 1Q FY 2024.  The\nDSC Extension includes supporting test, engineering, software, and performance-based logistics scope. In 2022, the MDA Ground Test Replan resulted in the extension\nof minimal contract line items to support testing, engineering, hardware and software until December 2024 to complete the delivery of Missile Defense System Increment\n6B.2; while performance-based logistics will transition to a new contract after December 2023. The DSC structure breaks out major efforts into separate Contract Line\nItem Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability.\nMDA implemented a robust Program Board structure allowing more Government insight and decisions into the technical baseline and has changed business processes\nfor greater Government involvement in program decisions consistent with the Government's ownership of the technical baseline.  In addition, GMD utilizes Government\nlaboratory modeling and simulation and analysis capabilities to augment the current DSC efforts. These efforts utilize existing, competitively awarded contracts by\nMDA and Other Government Agencies including Vandenberg Space Force Base, California; Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center; U.S. Army Combat\nCapabilities Development Command Aviation & Missile Center (formerly known as U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and engineering Center); and\nPacific Missile Range Facility, HI.\nOther GMD contracts will satisfy future GMD Element requirements beyond DSC's support and Missile Defense System Increment 6B.2.  These contracts initiated\nand are executing concurrently with the DSC and provide for transition periods while the DSC scope is completing to provide continuity of effort.  Each of the new\ncontracts are structured to break out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property\naccountability.\nMDA competitively awarded two best value contracts on March 24, 2021 to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for technology and product development of Next\nGeneration Interceptor maintained both contracts through the Preliminary Design Review. Each Contractor's design development and component testing leading to\ncompletion of a PDR and Knowledge Point #1 provides significant risk reduction and confidence to select a Next Generation Interceptor All Up Round design to proceed\nto the Critical Design Review and beyond.  MDA established future knowledge points and flight tests to evaluate Next Generation Interceptor components and GMD\nWeapon System performance during continued development and to support future production decisions.\nMDA awarded/plans to award sole source contracts to the GMD's Ground Based Interceptor In-Service Fleet (ISF) original equipment manufacturers to perform service\nlife extensions and maintain the existing fleet, execute repairs, and develop software.  These contracts are intended primarily to ensure fleet viability until replacement\nVolume 2a - 95"

ISF is constrained to the legacy interceptor fleet and its component boosters and kill vehicles. The Boost Vehicle\nSustainment Contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in September 2021.  The EKV Sustainment Contract was awarded in June 2023 to Raytheon Missile\nSystems.  The Ground Based Interceptor Integration and Test acquisition is planned for award in FY 2024.\nThe GMD Weapon System (GWS) Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to provide design, development,\nproduction, product level testing, sustainment planning, and maintenance of the current Weapon System.  The GWS contractor is responsible for developing weapon\nsystem solutions, including fire control and communication systems improvements, required to update the legacy system to remain effective while the Next Generation\nInterceptor is under development, as well as, preparing for the seamless introduction of Next Generation Interceptor and other future Missile Defense System\ncapabilities.  The GWS contract will update the system interface for the addition of Next Generation Interceptors to the fleet, provide the Warfighter capability to operate\nthe GMD Weapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, and identify and develop solutions for message exchanges\nbetween the GMD Weapon System and in-flight kill vehicles.  All of this must be accomplished while maintaining a robust cyber defense network capable of detecting\nand defending against current and future cybersecurity threats.\nMDA also competitively awarded a System Integration, Test, and Readiness (SITR) Contract to provide, along with the Technical Direction Agent, a synergistic\napproach in executing the GMD Element-level engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the GMD Weapon System, which operates with the current Ground-\nBased Interceptor and is adding infrastructure for the integration and testing of Next Generation Interceptor.  The SITR contract was awarded on September 1, 2022 to\nThe Boeing Company. The SITR contractor is charged with being the Government's technical partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon\nSystem alongside the United States Northern Command Warfighters.  While the Government maintains overall system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR\ncontractor will assume a supporting role responsible for ensuring overall GMD integration including physical and logical integration of the GMD Components to include\nNext Generation Interceptor, GMD Element, and MDA enterprise level integration, planning and execution of all necessary testing to verify and validate requirements\ncompliance.\nGMD Increment 6C, 10, and 11 will be executed with the SITR and GWS contracts.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and program offices.  With a focus to achieve Small Business goals, MDA is leveraging existing MDA Consolidated Support\ncontracts and will utilize MDA competitively awarded new contracts to acquire Fiscal Years 2020-2030 Advisory and Assistance Services support.\nThe Next Generation Interceptor will be an integrated capability of the greater GMD Element, and will provide a fully qualified, production representative Next Generation\nInterceptor All Up Round (AUR). Once the Next Generation Interceptor AUR is accepted by the Government, it will be integrated into the GMD Element and supported\nby the SITR Contract while the GWS Contract will support developing the interfaces necessary for the seamless integration of Next Generation Interceptor. The funding\nfor the development of the Next Generation Interceptor is in Program Element 0604874C Improved Homeland Defense Interceptors.\nThe Integrated Research and Development for Enterprise Solutions contract is used to provide cyber related equipment, licenses, and support.\nVolume 2a - 96"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense System network of layered sensors provides essential situational awareness and fire control data for the command and control of Missile Defense\nSystem weapon systems, such as Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense\n(THAAD). The suite of remote ground-based sensors provides early warning, midcourse, and terminal missile defense threat data. This data enables layered detection\nand tracking of missile targets, providing fire-control quality position, velocity, and discrimination data through GMD Fire Control, or Command and Control, Battle\nManagement and Communications (C2BMC).\nOverlapping coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data, reduces the impact of the loss of any one sensor, and reduces the\npotential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces\nthe number of target engagements required, thereby conserving interceptor inventory and maintaining a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-\nbased sensors enable C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against missile threats.\nThis Program Element (PE) includes Missile Defense System threat discrimination improvements, which will enhance Missile Defense System effectiveness against\nthe evolving adversary threat.  The result will be a Missile Defense System architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying reentry vehicles with a higher\ndegree of confidence, improving Warfighter shot doctrine, and more efficiently using interceptor inventory.  Missile Defense System threat discrimination improvements\nare funded from the Enabling (0603890C), Midcourse (0603882C), BMD Sensors (0603884C), C2BMC (0603896C), and Aegis BMD (0603892C) PEs.\nThe Missile Defense System Sensors Program contributes to regional and homeland missile defense by developing, delivering, and deploying/redeploying Army Navy/\nTransportable Radar Surveillance and Control-2 (AN/TPY-2) radars for operations or tests. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate as either a THAAD Fire Unit\nRadar (terminal mode) or a Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable and add flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. Radars provide\nearly warning tracking and discrimination data through all phases of missile flight. Through the Missile Defense System C2BMC and coalition data links, the AN/TPY-2\nVolume 2a - 111"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense System Information Management Systems budget project funds information technology mission critical functions necessary for the efficient\noperations and safeguarding of Missile Defense System information in compliance with DoD policies and in keeping pace with the ever-growing cyber threat which\nis one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face. Information Technology (IT) is critical to the day-to-day functions of MDA personnel to\ncommunicate (classified and unclassified) with each other, Congress, senior DoD and other U.S. Government agency personnel, Combatant Commanders, NATO\npartners, and other industry partners. Communication among these organizations facilitates the MDA mission of developing and fielding an integrated Missile Defense\nSystem to defend the United States, our deployed forces, allies, and friends against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all phases of flight.\nMDA information management systems capabilities support rigorous missile defense Research, Development, Test and Engineering (RDT&E) and facilitate the\ndevelopment of technologies to guard against evolving missile threats. Communications are vital for missile defense to continue a viable homeland defense against\nrogue threats and to provide the integration required to defend deployed forces, allies, and friends against theater threats. Missile Defense System information\nmanagement consists of MDA Special Purpose Processing Nodes (SPPNs), IT systems, data centers, operations and monitoring centers which are vital to support the\nstrategic mission of the Agency and necessary to meet disaster recovery and continuity of operations requirements. This infrastructure is required to sustain access to\nthe Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network, MDA classified and unclassified networks, classified and unclassified video\nteleconferencing services, test and business knowledge data centers, and the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN). These mission critical functions provide\nfor the efficient operation and safeguarding of all agency information in locations supporting MDA around the world.\nProject MD30 is aligned into the following inter-agency mission critical IT services and the associated plans in accordance with the Federal Information Technology\nShared Services Strategy.\n1. End User Support\n2. SPPNs\n3. IT Planning and Solutions\n4. Unified Communications\n5. Portal and Data Services\n6. Business Automation Services\nVolume 2a - 211"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nA number of key IT strategies were identified in the DoD IT Enterprise Strategy and Roadmap issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2011. The IT Roadmap\nspecifically addresses the need to improve Cybersecurity. It states that DoD networks are under constant attack from cybersecurity threats launched from various\nsources. The MDA must meet the National Command Authority Directives for rapid deployment of the Missile Defense System while complying with the key principles of\nCybersecurity standards to ensure MDA remains a secure member of the DoD Information Network.\nDoD Instruction 8500.01 Cybersecurity issued in March 2014, requires continuous monitoring, data analysis, reporting and incident mitigation of DoD classified and\nunclassified, mission, test and administrative networks. To comply with the Instruction, MDA must implement a multi-tiered cybersecurity risk management capability to\nprotect critical Missile Defense System data and systems from rapidly evolving internal and external threats.\nThis project provides funds to sustain the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities, analysis of validation results, risk\nassessments and reviews of proposed Program Manager/Information Systems Security Manager (PM/ISSM) Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for the MDA\nmission, test and common-use IT systems. Maintains the Authorization and Assessment (A&A) data repository, capturing the RMF documentation (artifacts, validation\nresults, and Cybersecurity Risk Assessment results, and Authorizing Official (AO) decisions) and POA&M on all MDA information systems. Supports the monitoring and\ntracking of Cybersecurity mitigations detailed in IT cybersecurity POA&Ms. Activities include preparation of A&A documentation and authorization recommendations\nto the MDA PM/ISSM and AO. Independent Verification and Validation team actions ensure the availability, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA\nmission, test and common-use IT systems. Activities in the Project are necessary to comply with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).\nThis project funds the MDA Global Network Operations and Security Center (GNOSC) responsible for monitoring, managing, patching, and maintaining MDA network\nand core IT services; issuing and tracking Technical Compliance Orders; and coordinating overarching Enterprise Network Operations. The GNOSC provides the\nnetwork security operations centers and supporting processes to protect and defend the MDA Enterprise information and information systems.\nThe MDA's Tier II Cybersecurity Service Provider- Computer Emergency Response Team (CSSP-CERT), monitors the MDA classified and unclassified IT RDT&E and\ncommon-use IT networks and reports vulnerabilities. The MDA CSSP coordinates with U.S. Cyber Command to identify and implement network vulnerability updates\nand patches to comply with U.S. Cyber Command vulnerabilities identified for DoD networks. In FY 2020, the MDA CSSP began taking over CSSP responsibilities from\nUnited States Strategic Command in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510.01F, DoD O-8530.1 and the DoD Cybersecurity\nDiscipline Implementation Plan.\nVolume 2a - 224"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) program consists of system and product planning, development, integration, and operation;\nthreat model development, verification, and analysis; and integration and deployment of improved M&S capabilities. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific\nneeds of the Agency's test events and to match Missile Defense System components in their various stages of development, ranging from low-to-medium fidelity\nanalyses supporting concept definitions studies, to high-fidelity models used to support engineering level activities. MDA validates and accredits System-level models\nand simulations by anchoring them to ground and flight test events, per the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP), to enable accurate and comprehensive assessments.\nMDA's M&S systems and products provide analysis, decision-making, and planning capabilities for Real-World Operations to inform the National Command Authority,\nJoint Staff, Military Services, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Combatant Commanders (CCMDs), Operational Test Authority (OTAs), Director of Operational Test &\nEvaluation (DOT&E), and Allies.\nMDA's M&S Program executes a single, integrated, and synchronized program to manage M&S development and sustainment; improves System Flight and Ground\nTest execution and provides a digital assessment venue; leverages MDA test activities to collect data to anchor models and simulations; and supports Warfighter training\nand tactics validation.\nThe M&S program also addresses the following key elements of DOT&E assessments: Ensure that future M&S architectures are composable and flexible, and simplify\nthe integration process to conserve resources and improve capabilities; Ensure that future M&S architectures incorporate and require the use of consistent truth\nrepresentations (phenomenology, lethality, environmental factors, threat simulations, etc.); Improve cross-organizational system engineering processes to optimize\nrequirements generation and ensure the inclusion of all stakeholders; Develop refined M&S accreditation criteria between MDA and the OTA; Enable top-down systems\nengineering and management of agency-wide M&S federations.\nB.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Sea-Based Weapon Systems element acquisition approach supports evolutionary development, continuously building upon demonstrated capabilities to advance\noverall BMDS capability. After considering all the technical and management aspects of the program and to meet the requirements presented by an evolving ballistic\nmissile threat, the Sea-Based Weapon Systems program awarded sole source contracts to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin to continue development of the SM-3 and the\nAegis BMD Weapon System, respectively.\nThe M&S acquisition strategy utilizes full and open competition to develop, acquire and deliver the integrated architectures/frameworks, as well as develop and deliver\nmodels of Aegis systems. The Digital and HWIL product centers integrate the suite of M&S into a composite simulation capability, all based on an open architecture.\nM&S achieves this end-state via close collaboration between its integrating contractor teams (Digital and HWIL) and those of the Aegis BMD prime contractors, with\nadditional technical standards and engineering oversight provided by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated\nResearch Centers.\nThe acquisition strategy for Guam Defense consists of contract actions to industry, and agreements with Department of Defense organizations and FFRDCs to develop,\ndemonstrate, and field a Missile Defense System on Guam.\nVolume 2a - 293"

The SM-3 Block IB Kinetic Warhead's (KW) two color infra-red (IR) seeker and advanced\nsignal processor provides a real-time discrimination and characterization capability while improving sensitivity for longer range targets and performance against more\nsophisticated threats. Additionally, the Block IB new TDACS KW divert engine has been upgraded over the SM-3 Block IA to provide a more flexible divert in order to\nmaneuver the KW to intercept.\nThe SM-3 Block IIA consists of an upgrade to a 21-inch diameter SM-3 missile and expands beyond the SM-3 Block IB battlespace to counter Intermediate Range\nBallistic Missile.  SM-3 Block IIA provides an increased kinematic envelope through improved IR discrimination and divert capability that provide performance against the\nEuropean Phased Approach phase III expanded threat set.  When combined with Aegis BMD 5.1 weapon system modifications, the SM-3 Block IIA will provide Engage\non Remote (EoR) capability, which allows the use of remote off board sensor information to launch and guide the SM-3 Block IIA to final intercept.  Aegis BMD 5.1 EoR\ncapability with SM-3 Block IIA also frees up radar resources and increases the number and type of threats to be engaged simultaneously over previous baselines.\nB.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nPWS contains non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Missile Defense System. These functions include\nGovernment Civilians and Contract Support Services. This effort provides integrity and oversight of the Missile Defense System as well as supports MDA in the\ndevelopment and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes personnel to support global deployments performing\ndeployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations worldwide.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Joint Warfighter Support Program (JWSP) is the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) primary means for providing direct technical support to Combatant Commands\n(CCMDs), the Military Services, and the Joint Staff on Missile Defense System development, testing, operational support, and configuration management. It enables\ndelivery of Missile Defense System capabilities to Warfighters and ensures their participation in the identification and development of new Missile Defense (MD)\ncapabilities via the Warfighter Involvement Process. The JWSP allows the Warfighter and MDA to work together to identify gaps, seams, and needs in warfighting\ncapability and enhance Missile Defense System attributes by submitting modification and fielding requests.  It also provides 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days\na year MD operational support to Warfighters worldwide, to include global system verification and validation over the operational Common Interactive Broadcast.  The\nprogram enables rapid response to Warfighter Requests for Information and Requests for Analyses, which are especially critical to mission success in protecting U.S.\nForces and other defended assets during Real World threat events. The program also supports improving products delivered to Warfighters through technical reviews\nand technical analyses supporting strategic and regional MD planning, development of shot doctrine and MD design.  The JWSP also enables the inclusion of both\nCCMD and MDA MD objectives in CCMD/Joint Staff-sponsored Wargames and Exercises, which are used to sharpen and enhance joint MD warfighting skills.  Finally,\nthe JWSP administers all Navy Reserve support personnel and handles coordination for Army, Air Force and Space Force Reserve that provide technical, engineering,\nintelligence, integration, and operational support to the MDA.\nVolume 2a - 403"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe MDA - U.S. Israeli Cooperative Program Office jointly manages the Arrow Program with Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) to ensure that all systems\nare delivered with quality, on time, on budget, and meet the needs of the warfighter. The program funding is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel with Israel\nproviding matching contributions. However, a portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint\nprogram initiation. Contracts are awarded by IMDO or MDA, dependent on what is most advantageous to the Joint Governments. In regard to AWS, IMDO contracts\non behalf of U.S. government with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies. For the ITB, the MDA contracts directly with Elbit\nSystems, Ltd. while IMDO provides an equitable share of the funding to the U.S. Finally, MDA provides funding and contracts directly with WALES, Ltd. for the ISA&I\nprogram.\nVolume 2a - 499"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) utilizes a disciplined system engineering process to develop and integrate the Missile Defense System into an effective, layered defense\nagainst ballistic missiles of all ranges during all phases of flight. This process consists of the following steps: Plan, Define, Design, Build, Test and Verify, Assess, and\nDeliver Missile Defense System Capability, followed by transfer of selected capabilities. The Missile Defense System Test Program Element is responsible for testing\nthat provides critical data to: determine validity of models and simulations used to verify and assess Missile Defense System capabilities; validate that Elements and\nComponents are properly designed, built, and integrated; and provide confidence that the Missile Defense System will perform as designed.  Results from the Test and\nVerify step provide feedback into the Plan, Define, and Design steps to identify areas for system improvements. Key to the systems engineering process is Modeling\nand Simulation (M&S), which reflects the integrated operational system's performance. Confidence in M&S is based on a comprehensive Verification, Validation, and\nAccreditation process. The Missile Defense System Test Program, as documented in the IMTP, has a primary emphasis to provide the data necessary to verify and\nassess Missile Defense System capabilities in support of Technical Capability Declarations, and to anchor Missile Defense System M&S.  As models are validated and\naccredited, MDA and the Missile Defense System Operational Test Agency Team will utilize these models to assess Missile Defense System capabilities through a\ncampaign of ground testing.\nMissile Defense System Test Program Functions include:\n- Represent MDA as the single test authority to the test and evaluation community, international cooperative program representatives, and other organization\nrepresentatives.\n- Develop and implement MDA test policy, standards, tools, products, and processes to enable effective tests while balancing MDA and element programmatic needs.\n- Develop an IMTP that compiles all MDA test objectives, test schedules, and funding requirements from the year of execution through the Future Years Defense\nProgram time period and beyond.\n- Act as the single point of contact in MDA for all external ranges and common test resources.\n- Provide, maintain, and develop common test resources and infrastructure required to execute tests in the MDA Test Program by leveraging element laboratories,\nranges, executing agents, and functional expertise, as applicable.\n- Certify that test personnel are trained and equipped to conduct safe and effective tests.\nVolume 2a - 509"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Missile Defense System Test Program acquisition strategy is consistent with the MDA capabilities-based acquisition strategy that emphasizes testing, evolutionary\nacquisition, and knowledge-based funding. Test directs a team of various internal staff (government and scientific, engineering and technical assistance support),\nexecuting agents including the DoD agencies, Service Organizations, Laboratories and Program Offices, Federally Funded Research and Development Center and\nother MDA programs to execute the various diverse efforts within the Missile Defense System test program through competition. When a specific effort/activity being\nconducted, acquired, or maintained requires the use of an executing agent, respective headquarter regulations are used to conform the acquisition strategy.\nThe MDA IMTP establishes and documents the test requirements for the Missile Defense System with the specific focus on collecting the data needed for the\nVerification, Validation, and Accreditation of the Missile Defense System M&S. This paradigm uses critical factor analysis to drive test design, planning, and execution\nfor accrediting M&S, which is used to validate and assess system performance. With this test approach, MDA will establish confidence that the M&S used to evaluate the\nMissile Defense System represent real world behavior, thereby enabling simulation-based performance assessment to verify system functionality.\nVolume 2a - 518"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe mission of the Missile Defense System Targets Program is to provide an economical and reliable inventory of targets that are representative of feasible future\nthreats. These targets enable demonstration of Missile Defense System capabilities in operationally realistic scenarios. The Missile Defense System Targets Program\ndevelops and acquires five target types across four target classes. The classes include: Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM), Medium Range Ballistic Missiles\n(MRBM), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The target types (Type 1-5) designate the complexity of the target\nwithin its class. Type-1 (T1) targets are simple baseline configurations. Type-2 (T2) targets have increased capability or complexity. Type-3 (T3) targets have unique\nconfigurations.  Type-4 (T4) targets are subscale targets. Type-5 (T5) targets are advanced targets.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program develops and provides Modified Ballistic Re-Entry Vehicles (MBRV) and Countermeasures that can be used across\nthe spectrum of target types and classes. The Missile Defense System Targets Program provides target digital models that enable the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)\nweapon system program offices to simulate end to end sensor and interceptor performance during pre-mission analysis. The Missile Defense System Targets Program\nalso provides maintenance, aging surveillance, refurbishment, and routine testing of government furnished equipment boosters and target components.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program carefully plans the year of execution to assure the best use of appropriated funds.  However, the Missile Defense System\nTargets Program must be flexible in its execution of the program in order to respond to emerging real world threats or changes in the intelligence community estimates of\nwhen a threat will be deployed.  The Missile Defense System Targets Program must also work with missile defense systems engineers on a continuing basis to align the\ntargets program to the Missile Defense System need to demonstrate capabilities as reflected in the Missile Defense System IMTP.  The Missile Defense System Targets\nProgram makes every effort to reduce instability in contracts, production base and budget while managing in this dynamic work environment.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program develops and builds targets and countermeasures at multiple locations including:  Orlando, FL; Huntsville, AL; and\nChandler, AZ. Storage and maintenance facilities are also located throughout the country including:  Huntsville, AL; White Sands, NM; Ogden, UT; Tooele, UT; and\nCape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program consists of four major areas: Consumables, Program Planning and Operations, Resources, and Flight Test Execution.\nB.

Target development provides air and ground\nlaunch capabilities to maximize flexibility in MDA test design. Development activities include requirements decomposition, design,\nmodeling and simulation, qualification testing, characterization, missionization, and mission analysis. The Missile Defense\nSystem Targets Program Office manages target configuration, component interface specifications, range integration, reliability,\nmission assurance, and costs. The Missile Defense System Targets Program ensures target designs are producible, reliable, and\naffordable.\nTarget manufacturing includes the build of targets and target components that are required to execute the Missile Defense System\nIMTP. Manufacturing includes government furnished equipment and new component acquisition, assembly, and integration. Also\nincluded are target characterization, quality and mission assurance, transportation, and logistics support. The Missile Defense\nSystem Targets Program delivers fully assembled and integrated targets to the Missile Defense System Test Program.  Future\nrevisions to the IMTP will likely affect target types and quantities noted in the Planned Accomplishments.\nSpecific and/or unique planned accomplishments to each FY are as follows:\nFY 2024 Plans:\n-SRBM T4 - continue development efforts, complete qualification of SRBM T4 Ship Set 27 to support pre-ship readiness review in\nFY 2024\n-Continue SRBM T4 kit development and manufacturing efforts to support future target performance requirements for flight tests\nbeginning in FY 2024\n-Continue development efforts for SRBM T4 countermeasures\nFY 2025 Plans:\n-SRBM T4 - complete qualification of SRBM T4 Ship Sets 1 and 3 to support pre-ship readiness reviews in FY2025\n-Continue SRBM T4 development and recurring engineering efforts\nFY 2024 to FY 2025 Increase/Decrease Statement:\nDecrease from FY 2024 to FY 2025 reflects completion of four SRBM T4 ship sets in FY 2024 to support future flight tests in\naccordance with current IMTP requirements.\n-   -   -  \nTitle: Consumables - Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) 222.459 268.894 293.568\nVolume 2a - 565"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program delivers targets and countermeasures for Missile Defense System flight-testing to counter evolving threats. Program\nrequirements are derived from the Missile Defense System IMTP and from multiple Target System Performance Specifications (TSPS).\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program is currently in various acquisition and contracting stages to deliver targets and countermeasures per multiple TSPS by\ntarget class: SRBM, MRBM, IRBM, and ICBM.  Each target class may be independently solicited, evaluated, and competitively awarded based on the IMTP 'need date'\npriority order.  The Targets Program also delivers countermeasures based on requirements and TSPS.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2011 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) with a Period of\nPerformance (PoP) of March 2011 through December 2025 for air-launched IRBM targets.  This award included two follow-on options, one for (8) eight IRBM targets\nexercised in 2014 and another for (6) six IRBM targets exercised in 2017.  Two IRBM targets were added on the contract in 2018 to support the Missile Defense System\nAcceleration efforts.  This contract also included the development and delivery of ICBM targets.  The contract scope included two ICBM Stage Zero Retrofit Kits to be\ninstalled in existing air-launched IRBM targets.  Four ICBM Stage Zero Kits were added in 2018.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2016 to NGSC with a PoP of July 2016 to December 2020 for three MRBM\nT3c2 targets.  This award included options for up to four MRBM T3c2 targets.  In August 2020 a modification was awarded to extend the base contract through March\n2024 to account for two flight tests scheduled for FY 2023 and FY 2024.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2013 to L-3 Communications/Coleman Aerospace Corporation (Now Aerojet\nRocketdyne Coleman Aerospace) with a PoP of October 2013 through December 2029 to provide six MRBM targets.  Six additional targets were added to the contract\nin 2019 to incorporate additional IMTP requirements.  The option for the third lot of six additional targets was also added to the contract in 1Q FY 2023 and the PoP was\nextended to December 2029.  The first target from this contract was successfully launched in 4th Quarter, FY 2019.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2019 to NGSC with a PoP of September 2019 through September 2024 to\ndeliver T4 Subscale Targets.  This T4 Subscale contract has a base quantity of four SRBMs, five MRBMs, with options for up to 17 SRBMs and 7 MRBMs.\nVolume 2a - 573"

NSWC PHD WS has unique sounding rocket expertise and\naccess to existing contracts that makes this a beneficial relationship for both parties.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program also acquires SRBM subscale targets (Black Dagger and Zombie) with special/unique guidance requirements through\nMIPRs from the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program competitively awarded a prime contract in 2017 to Lockheed Martin with a base PoP of November 2017 through\nDecember 2022.  In December 2021, the period of performance was extended to January 2027.  This action also moved from delivery of in-line missionization hardware\nto delivery of hardware that has been configured to a generic configuration.  Based on this concept, missionization will occur once a mission has been identified in the\nIMTP.  This effort currently requires the delivery of three MBRV-7 Configuration 2 (C2) and five MBRV-8 C2 targets, with options for two MBRV-7 C2 and five MBRV-8\nC2 targets, as set forth in the IMTP.  The program will begin to implement obsolescence activities as some of the avionics components and/or their constituent parts\nhave begun to reach the end of their availability.  In order to continue providing MBRV/Re-Entry Vehicle Separation Module -7 & -8 front ends for the remaining target\ndevelopment under this contract, the obsolete avionics components must be updated and the corresponding spares must be de-scoped from the contract.  Spares for\nthe new avionics components will be added as an option which the Government will exercise if required.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program awarded a sole source contract in 2013 to Lockheed Martin with a base PoP of January 2014 through September\n2016.  The Program Office awarded a contract modification to the Targets and Countermeasures Highly Specialized Services contract that extended the PoP through\nSeptember 2027.  This effort provides missionization requirements-preparation and flight readiness of target assets, ordnance handling, and execution of mission\nreviews to support specific flight-test objectives for MBRVs.\nThe Targets Program initiated development efforts with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab for the Hypersonic Target Vehicle-2 (HTV-2) utilizing an existing\ncontract through MDA's Directorate of Engineering team.  The Program Office plans to continue non-recurring engineering with University Affiliated Research Center and\nFFRDC partners, to include Sandia National Laboratories, for an alternate advance target re-entry vehicles materiel solutions.\nThe Missile Defense System Targets Program future acquisition planning and solicitations will go through MDA Acquisition Strategy Panel(s)/Board(s) for decision-\nmaking.  Future acquisition strategies are based on two premises: a) utilize existing capabilities/infrastructure and sustain an industrial base to deliver targets; and b)\ninitiate acquisitions that delivers low cost/affordable targets that emulate evolving threats.\nVolume 2a - 574"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nPWS contains non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Missile Defense System. These functions include\nGovernment Civilians and Contract Support Services. This effort provides integrity and oversight of the Missile Defense System as well as supports MDA in the\ndevelopment and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes personnel to support global deployments performing\ndeployment site preparation and activation, and provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations worldwide.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe LRDR program supports and contributes to the Missile Defense Agency mission of developing and deploying a layered Missile Defense System to defend the\nhomeland from missile attacks of all ranges, in all phases of flight by providing persistent long-range midcourse discrimination, precision tracking and hit assessment\nas an element of the Missile Defense System Homeland Defense Capability. The LRDR program also supports the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) and Space Object\nIdentification (SOI) mission area.\nThe LRDR Program Element includes the requirements to design, develop, integrate, deliver, field, and sustain the LRDR. The LRDR operates in the S-band frequency\nwith a scalable and open systems architecture to mitigate evolving threats and integrates into the Missile Defense System through the Command and Control, Battle\nManagement, and Communications (C2BMC) system. This Program Element includes Missile Defense System threat discrimination improvements to enhance\neffectiveness against the evolving threat. The result will be a Missile Defense System architecture more capable of discriminating and interpreting re-entry vehicles with\na higher degree of confidence to improve Warfighter engagement doctrine, and conserve Ground Based Interceptor inventory. The LRDR is comprised of an equipment\nshelter, two radar array faces, a mission control facility for radar operations, and supporting facilities and infrastructure. The Secretary of the Air Force approved Clear\nSpace Force Station, formerly known as Clear Air Force Station, AK as the LRDR site. The United States Space Force (USSF) Space Operations Command is the\ndesignated Lead Major Command. The initial fielding of LRDR was completed on December 6, 2021.  In cooperation with the Northern Command, the Space Command,\nand the USSF, an incremental fielding approach is being taken.  The early use fielding of the LRDR SDA capability is planned for early FY 2024.  Fielding of the LRDR\nIncrement 6B.1 capability will occur when LRDR is added to the Missile Defense System Operational Capability Baseline (OCB), currently planned for 1Q FY 2025,\ndelayed by the replanning of formal ground testing of the final LRDR Increment 6B.1 software.

Acquisition Strategy\nThe approved LRDR acquisition strategy incorporates robust acquisition practices to ensure delivery of a best -value solution that meets mission performance\nrequirements and reduces lifecycle costs. The MDA awarded a fixed-price incentive contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation of Moorestown, NJ, on October 21, 2015,\nto design, develop, manufacture, integrate & test, and field the LRDR prime mission equipment.  The prime contract included other fixed-price and cost-reimbursable line\nitems and options to balance acquisition costs and risks. Performance and cost incentives were included to motivate contractor performance. The radar prime contractor\nwill deliver a complete technical data package, enabling the government to effectively and affordably sustain the system.  MDA synchronized the radar development\ncontract efforts with a simultaneous Military Construction effort executed through the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The LRDR completed the initial fielding milestone on\nDecember 6, 2021, for Missile Defense System integration and testing of the Increment 6B.1 capability and an expected fielding of LRDR when it is added to the Missile\nDefense System OCB in FY 2024.  The Acquisition Strategy was updated in FY 2021 to add the Increment 6C/7 capability.  MDA awarded Lockheed Martin a cost-plus\nincentive fee contract on September 20, 2021, to develop and deliver the Increment 6/7 software upgrade. An LRDR Acquisition Strategy Decision Memorandum was\nsigned in February 2023, granting authority to proceed with a sole source contract modification to Lockheed Martin to develop Increment 10 capability, which includes\nhardware and software sustainment. MDA approved the Justification and Approval in March 2023. The request for proposal was released to Lockheed Martin in May\n2023.\nVolume 2a - 680"

Acquisition Strategy\nGround-Based Midcourse Defense's (GMD's) overarching acquisition strategy included a competitive source selection to develop and test an integrated All Up Round\n(AUR) interceptor to meet Warfighter requirements and defeat the 2030 and beyond threat. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) competitively awarded two best value\ncontracts for the Next Generation Interceptor to Northrop Grumman (known as Next Generation Interceptor Gold Program) and Lockheed Martin (known as Next\nGeneration Interceptor Black Program) in March 2021. Each Contractor's design development and component testing led to completion of a PDR and KP #1, which\nprovides significant risk reduction and confidence to select a single Next Generation Interceptor All Up Round design to proceed to the Critical Design Review and\nbeyond. MDA established future knowledge points and flight tests to evaluate Next Generation Interceptor components and GMD Weapon System performance during\ncontinued development and to support future production decisions.\nVolume 2a - 700"

Based on successful capability\ndemonstration during multiple flight tests, MDA will seek progressive approvals from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to proceed with\nprocurement of operational AURs.\nA contract option is available to extend efforts through December 2028 for activities and hardware to support Missile Defense System Ground Testing, as well as\nactivities and hardware to deliver up to ten (10) Next Generation Interceptor units in an integrated AUR configuration to support the corresponding Missile Defense\nSystem flight test campaigns. Contemporaneous with KP #1, the contractors will submit a proposal for an additional test article and 20 production units, broken into two\nproduction lots.\nThe Next Generation Interceptor competitive acquisition strategy met its intended goals for the technology development phase with reduced technical risk, acceleration\nof technical maturity, and encouraged competitive efficiencies; this supports the Department's ability to field this critical capability to negate the expanding threat for\nUnited States Northern Command's (USNORTHCOM's) operational timeline.\nIn addition to the Next Generation Interceptor Contract, GMD's overarching Acquisition Strategy includes a GMD Weapon System (GWS) Contract and Systems\nIntegration, Test, and Readiness (SITR) Contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for Missile Defense System incremental delivery. Each\ncontract is structured to break out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual incentives for management insight, accounting, and property\naccountability.\nOther Enabling GMD Acquisition Strategies (budgeted for in PE 0603882C).\nThe GWS Contract was competitively awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation in July 2022 to provide design, development, production, product-level\ntesting, sustainment planning, and maintenance of the current GMD Weapon System products including development to integrate the Next Generation Interceptor\ninto the GMD Weapon System. The GWS contractor is responsible for developing weapon system solutions, including fire control and communication systems\nimprovements, required to update the legacy system to remain effective while Next Generation Interceptor is under development, as well as preparing for the integration\nof Next Generation Interceptor and other future Missile Defense System capabilities. The GWS Contract will provide the Warfighter capability to operate the GMD\nWeapon System with a mixed fleet of Ground Based Interceptors and Next Generation Interceptors, and enable communications exchanges between the GMD Weapon\nSystem and in-flight payloads. All of this must be accomplished while maintaining a robust cyber defense network capable of detecting and defending against current\nand future cybersecurity threats.\nThe MDA also competitively awarded the SITR Contract to provide, along with the Technical Direction Agent, a synergistic approach in executing the GMD engineering,\nintegration, test, and readiness of the integrated GMD Weapon System, which operates with the current Ground Based Interceptor and is adding infrastructure for the\nintegration and testing of Next Generation Interceptor. The SITR contractor is the Government's partner for day-to-day operation and sustainment of the fielded GMD\nWeapon System alongside the USNORTHCOM Warfighters. While the Government maintains overall weapon system integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR\nVolume 2a - 701"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThe Sea-Based Weapon Systems mission is to deliver an enduring, operationally effective and supportable Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability to defend the\nnation, deployed forces, friends and allies, and to increase this capability by delivering evolutionary improvements as part of Missile Defense System upgrades. The\nSea-Based Weapon Systems element of the Missile Defense System capitalizes upon and evolves from the existing U.S. Navy Aegis Weapon System and Standard\nMissile (SM) infrastructures. Sea-Based Weapon Systems provides a forward-deployable, mobile capability to detect and track Ballistic Missiles of all ranges, and\nthe ability to destroy Short-Range Ballistic Missiles, Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles, and Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles in the midcourse phase of flight, and\nshorter range missiles in the terminal phase of flight. Sea-Based Weapon Systems also provides a Long Range Surveillance and Track capability to the Missile Defense\nSystem. Upgrades to both the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the SM-3 configuration enable Sea-Based Weapon Systems to provide effective, supportable defensive\ncapability against longer range, threats and an enduring Aegis Ashore defensive capability.\nThis Program Element works with all U.S. Armed Services that participate in the Missile Defense System level Operational Test Agency Team. With the support of the\nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a test program to improve confidence in missile defense capabilities\nunder development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the warfighter are operationally effective, suitable, and survivable. As part of the MDA's rigorous test\nprogram, System Pre-Flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. System Post-Flight\nReconstruction replicates the Missile Defense System configuration, actual environmental conditions, and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor Modeling and\nSimulation results. The IMTP is event-oriented and extends until the collection of all identified data is completed ensuring adequate test investments.\nVolume 2a - 735"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nThis program supports development of the Land-Based Standard Missile-3 capability, Aegis Ashore. On 17 September 2009, the President announced an overarching\nplan to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces, allies, and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The EPAA\npolicy specifically defines a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-\nbased capabilities.\nAegis Ashore is a key component of EPAA Phases II (Romania) and III (Poland) and provides Aegis BMD capability against short to intermediate-range ballistic\nmissiles in an ashore configuration. Aegis Ashore provides sophisticated engagement strategies and can adapt to threat updates within each sites designated area\nof responsibility.  Aegis Ashore re-hosts the required BMD components of a U.S. Navy Destroyer, including: SPY-1 radar; Vertical Launch System, Computing\nInfrastructure; Command and Control; Communications; Computers and Intelligence Systems; and Operator Consoles.\nAegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex operates as a test asset that continues to inform Aegis Weapon System and Aegis Combat System developmental efforts,\nintegration of hardware and software upgrades and modernization efforts, and analyzing real time anomalies experienced in testing and in operational scenarios.\nVolume 2a - 779"

Acquisition Strategy\nThe Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program will continue to execute testing, development, and evolutionary acquisition through incremental development.\nThe Agency acquisition strategy ensures GMD components are upgraded to improve GMD Weapon System performance in order to retain the proven GMD contribution\nto the Missile Defense System. This acquisition approach reduces obsolescence risk, provides incremental capability improvements, and allows decision makers to\nmake informed trades between cost, schedule, and performance while rapidly delivering improved operational and technological capabilities.\nMDA competitively awarded the Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) to The Boeing Company in December 2011. This contract included development,\nfielding, test, systems engineering, integration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrade; training, operations, and sustainment of the\nGMD Weapon System and associated support facilities. In January 2018, the DSC was extended with a new period of performance through 1Q FY 2024. The DSC\nExtension includes supporting test, engineering, software, and performance-based logistics scope. In 2022, the MDA Ground Test Re-plan resulted in the extension\nof minimal contract line items to support testing, engineering, hardware and software until December 2024; while performance-based logistics transitioned to a new\ncontract after December 2023. The DSC structure breaks out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual incentives for management insight,\naccounting, and property accountability.\nIn addition to the DSC, GMD's overarching Acquisition Strategy includes a Next Generation Interceptor Contract, Ground Based Interceptor sustainment contracts, a\nGMD Weapon System (GWS) Contract, and a Systems Integration, Test, and Readiness (SITR) Contract to execute the full scope of the GMD development efforts for\nMissile Defense System incremental delivery. Each of the contracts is structured to break out major efforts into separate Contract Line Item Numbers with individual\nincentives for management insight, accounting, and property accountability. The Midcourse Defense Segment Test acquisition transitions from the DSC to the SITR\nContract.\nGMD competitively awarded the SITR Contract on September 1, 2022 to provide, along with the Technical Direction Agent, a synergistic approach in executing the\nGMD engineering, integration, test, and readiness of the integrated GMD Weapon System, which operates with the current Ground-Based Interceptor and is adding\ninfrastructure for the integration and testing of Next Generation Interceptor. The SITR contractor is charged with being the Government's technical partner for day-to-day\noperation and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System alongside the United States Northern Command Warfighters. While the Government maintains overall weapon\nsystem integration responsibilities and authority, the SITR contractor will assume a supporting role responsible for ensuring overall GMD integration including physical\nand logical integration of the GMD Components, to include the Next Generation Interceptor, and Missile Defense System enterprise level integration, planning, and\nexecution of all necessary testing to verify and validate requirements compliance.\nGMD also uses MDA Consolidated Support contracts for engineering and technical support; studies, analyses, and evaluations; and management and professional\nservices to GMD functional organizations and project offices. With a focus to achieve Small Business goals, MDA is leveraging existing MDA Consolidated Support\ncontracts and will utilize MDA competitively awarded new contracts to acquire Fiscal Years 2020-2030 Advisory and Assistance Services support.\nVolume 2a - 810"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nSpacebased Kill Assessment (SKA): The SKA project will deliver dedicated space sensors contributing to hit and kill assessment for Homeland Defense. Missile\nDefense Agency (MDA) Missile Defense System intercept testing experience provided a solid understanding of kill assessment physics to enable exploration of this\ncritical capability. SKA incorporates Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations to examine the operational feasibility of disaggregating large satellites\nand to provide data for the business case for shared versus dedicated satellite control, including the ground antenna networks. The favorable cost and schedule\nperformance on SKA is also consistent with the GAO's assessment of hosted payload programs. The SKA experiment utilizes a network of small Infrared sensors\nintegrated onto host satellites that while on orbit observe missile defense intercepts and deliver situational awareness hit and kill assessment declarations.\nHBTSS:  HBTSS will demonstrate a schedule-focused, cost-constrained capability to detect and track hypersonic threats and boosting conventional ballistic missiles.\nThe key characteristic of HBTSS prototype demonstration that sets it apart from other Overhead Persistent Infrared sensors is the requirement to provide fire-control\nquality tracking data. The enhanced tracking accuracy through missile burn out on ballistic threats and the enhanced tracking accuracy on hypersonic threats will\nprovide the warfighter increased missile defense weapons systems engagement capability and higher accuracy impact predictions.  The requirement for fire-control\ndata necessitates that HBTSS be a highly sensitive, low-latency, high quality of service system. Following the successful demonstration of HBTSS capabilities, the\nresponsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the US Space Force and the MDA will continue the development of the next-generation of space-\nbased fire control sensors for missile defense. Operationally, the HBTSS fire-control capability will be part of Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter\nSpace Architecture and will detect hypersonic, ballistic, and other advanced threats much sooner than terrestrial radars, providing hypersonic threat-tracking data for\nhand off through linked missile defense weapons.\nVolume 2a - 839"

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification\nHBTSS will demonstrate a resilient, flexible, and global capability to detect and track hypersonic missiles and detect and track ballistic missiles in the boost phase of\nflight. The fire-control quality tracking data will allow long range engagement of the threat while enhanced tracking accuracy through missile burn out will provide the\nWarfighting community increased capability in missile defense weapons systems engagement and higher accuracy impact predictions.\nThe HBTSS prototype demonstration's priority is to maintain the pace of the development schedule given the urgent Warfighter need to address rapidly developing\nthreats. To meet this priority, HBTSS must use high technology readiness level components, take advantage of existing Government capabilities to minimize\ndevelopment, use a management culture that does not slow down the pace of development, and use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to minimize contracting cycle\ntimes. OTAs allow the Government to work with traditional, non-traditional, and new space businesses to identify innovative solutions.\nThe HBTSS prototype demonstration seeks to demonstrate the ability to meet requirements derived from United States Strategic Command Prioritized Capabilities\nList, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Capability Development Document for Missile Warning\n(MW)/Missile Defense (MD) Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR).\nThe HBTSS developed target detection algorithms and evaluated them in a Signal-chain Processing Demonstration, providing insight into the constellation architecture,\ncommunications approach, and preliminary command and control design aspects.  These results informed the development of the HBTSS prototype demonstration\nSpace Vehicles (SVs) and demonstrated the ability to detect and track dim targets in a cluttered background along with the sensitivity necessary to support the\nhypersonic kill chain.\nOperationally, the HBTSS fire-control capability will be part of Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture and will detect hypersonic,\nballistic, and other advanced threats much sooner than terrestrial radars, providing hypersonic threat-tracking data for hand off through linked missile defense weapons.\nAfter Launch and Early On-Orbit Testing (LEOT), HBTSS will conduct on-orbit testing, utilizing the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP), non-IMTP partner flight test\nevents, and Targets of Opportunity to test, characterize and validate the HBTSS performance.\nVolume 2a - 851"
